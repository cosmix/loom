#!/usr/bin/env bash
# knowledge-orient.sh - Claude Code SessionStart hook (GLOBAL - every
# repository, every session) that points a freshly started session at this
# checkout's curated knowledge index, doc/loom/knowledge/INDEX.md.
#
# Registered globally by fs/permissions/hooks/config.rs::build, unlike
# loom-hooks/session-start.sh which is a WORKTREE-only hook wired up at loom stage
# creation time (loom/src/hooks/config.rs). Without this, an ordinary
# interactive session in a repository that keeps a knowledge tree has nothing
# telling it the tree exists - CLAUDE.md rule 12's knowledge-first doctrine
# only reaches a session that already knows to look.
#
# Input: JSON from stdin - {"source": "startup"/"resume"/"compact"/"clear", ...}
#
# Output: at most ONE JSON object on stdout -
#   {"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "SessionStart", "additionalContext": "..."}}
# Every skip/failure path exits 0 with NO output, so a missing `jq`, a
# missing index, or a stage session never disturbs the session.
#
# Skipped entirely when:
#   - LOOM_STAGE_ID is set - a stage session reads its signal's Knowledge
#     Brief instead, and loom-hooks/session-start.sh (worktree-only) handles its
#     own re-anchor on compact/resume.
#   - `jq` is not on PATH - nothing here can safely parse the input or build
#     the output without it.
#   - `.source` is "compact" or "resume" - an interrupted session already has
#     context loaded; re-anchoring on resume is session-start.sh's job, not
#     this hook's.
#   - no doc/loom/knowledge/INDEX.md is found walking up from $PWD before a
#     `.git` repository boundary.
