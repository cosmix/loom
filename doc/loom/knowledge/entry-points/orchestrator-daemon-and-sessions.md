- `orchestrator/core/completion_handler.rs` - Auto-merge BEFORE marking completed
- `orchestrator/core/merge_handler.rs` - Conflict detection, merge session spawning

## Data Models

- `models/stage/types.rs` - Stage struct, StageStatus enum (13 states, including NeedsAdjudication)
- `models/stage/transitions.rs` - State transition validation
- `models/stage/methods.rs` - Stage operations (try_mark_executing, try_complete, timing)

**Insertion point for new shared helper:** `cache.rs` lines 51-169 (the "Shared content blocks" cluster). Call it from each of the 4 generator functions.

## Stage Completion (CLI)

- `commands/stage/complete.rs` - Top-level CLI completion entry; **`route_complete_for_conflicts` is the pure routing test seam** that decides Proceed vs ForceUnsafeAssumeMergedVerified vs SpawnResolver vs RevertAndSpawnResolver vs Refuse before any persistence.
- `commands/stage/merge.rs` - `loom stage merge [--resolved]`; wires `merge_verify` for ancestry check.
- `commands/stage/merge_resolver.rs` - CLI-side resolver spawn; uses `find_live_merge_session_for_stage` for single-resolver-per-stage guard.
- `commands/stage/merge_verify.rs` - `verify_or_derive_completed_commit` (read-only ancestry check shared by `--assume-merged` and `--resolved`).
- `orchestrator/merge_attribution.rs` - `attribute_main_repo_merge` and `reconcile_main_repo_active_merge` (free functions; the daemon-recovery test seam — no `Orchestrator` instance required).

## Terminal Backend

- `orchestrator/terminal/backend.rs` - `SessionBackend` dispatcher for native/tmux spawn, kill, and liveness
- `orchestrator/terminal/mod.rs` - terminal module root; re-exports backend and emulator types
- `orchestrator/terminal/native/mod.rs` - NativeBackend (spawn/kill/alive)
- `orchestrator/terminal/native/spawner.rs` - Claude Code session spawning (native)
- `orchestrator/terminal/emulator.rs` - 11 terminal emulator configs
- `orchestrator/terminal/native/detection.rs` - Auto-detect terminal
- `orchestrator/terminal/native/pid_tracking.rs` - Wrapper script, PID tracking, env vars
- `orchestrator/liveness.rs` - LivenessService: wraps the shared SessionBackend; fixed_for_tests() stub for unit tests

## Daemon Credentials and Operator Proofs

Daemon startup generates independent user and admin secrets. Both are published with no-follow,
mode-0600 creation beneath the mode-0700 `.loom/work/` directory. The user secret authenticates Ping,
status/log subscriptions, Unsubscribe, and DisputeCriteria. Authentication is checked from a fixed,
allocation-free request preface before the bounded JSON body is accepted.

Startup also publishes `.ignore` and `ripgreprc` at the state root, before either token, via
`daemon/server/tokens.rs::publish_fresh_tokens`. The session wrapper
(`orchestrator/terminal/native/wrapper.rs`) exports `RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH` pointing at the published
`ripgreprc`, but only when that file already exists at spawn time; a `loom run --foreground`
orchestrator runs no daemon, so it publishes neither tokens nor exclusions and its sessions get no
export. A sandboxed agent's `rg`/`fd`/`ag` opening `admin.token` or `user.token` hits the sandbox's
own deny rule and stalls auto mode on an operator prompt, so both files keep ordinary sweeps and
`-uu`/`--no-ignore` sweeps away from the credential files. No `Read(...)` permission deny is
written for the tokens at all; the OS-level `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` list and
`loom-hooks/credential-guard.sh` cover them, for the reason in concerns.md § "No `Read(...)` Deny Rule
May Exist in Any Settings File".

Privileged actions do not treat the mere presence of `.loom/work/admin.token` as authorization. The
operator supplies that secret only to the proof-minting process through `LOOM_ADMIN_TOKEN`; the
target command receives an action-bound proof through `LOOM_ADMIN_PROOF` and never reads the token.
Proofs are HMAC-SHA256-bound to the project, action, stage (when applicable), and privileged flag
set, then consumed through a private atomic replay marker. The integrated shutdown flow is
`loom stage admin-proof --daemon-stop`, followed by `loom stop` with the minted proof in
`LOOM_ADMIN_PROOF`.

`daemon/server/client.rs` verifies the preface in constant time and fails closed on missing or
malformed credentials. `commands/stage/admin_proof.rs` owns minting, exact-request verification,
and replay protection.

## Dispute Criteria — Current Implementation

`commands/stage/dispute_criteria.rs` is a **thin RPC client**, not a state mutator:

```rust
pub fn dispute_criteria(
    stage_id: String,
    criterion_index: usize,
    reason: String,
    evidence_commit: Option<String>,
    failure_output_path: Option<PathBuf>,
) -> Result<()>
```

- CLI: `loom stage dispute-criteria <stage-id> --criterion-index N --reason <text> [--evidence-commit <sha>] [--failure-output <path>]`
- Sends `Request::DisputeCriteria` over the daemon socket. The **daemon** writes `.loom/work/disputes/<stage>/<n>/request.md` and transitions the stage to `NeedsAdjudication`, then returns the allocated id.
- **Credentials: a missing `.loom/work/user.token` is the NORMAL case here, not an error.** An earlier version of this section said the client "reads `.loom/work/user.token`" and treated absence as fatal — that made the command unusable from the one place it was ever needed, because the sandbox denies a stage agent that read by design (S-1: the token authorizes every User RPC, not just the ones a stage agent is entitled to). The client now presents `daemon::rpc::user_credential()`, which falls back to a non-empty placeholder, and names the session it is running inside via `LOOM_SESSION_ID`. The daemon authorizes it by the connection instead — see `daemon/server/self_service.rs`.
- `--failure-output` is a path; the client loads it and truncates to 4KB on a UTF-8 char boundary.
- The agent never writes `.loom/work/disputes/<stage>/<n>/verdict.md` or `applied.marker` — both are daemon-only.
- With no daemon listening the dispute cannot be filed at all (the daemon is what persists it), and the command says so rather than reporting a bare connect error.
- Server-side handler: `daemon/server/dispute.rs`. On-disk schema: `models/dispute.rs`.

## Fix Attempts Counter — Current Usage

`models/stage/types.rs:254` — `fix_attempts: u32` field:

- Incremented: `commands/stage/merge.rs` for an actual merge retry, using locked `update_stage`
- Reset to 0: `commands/stage/human_review.rs:87` on human approve
- Default max: 3 (via `get_effective_max_fix_attempts()` in methods.rs)
- Warning printed when limit reached with hint to `loom stage dispute-criteria`

Alongside it on the `Stage` struct (all shipped): `dispute_count` (600), `evidence_rounds` (603), `amendments_applied` (606).

## TruthCheck / before_stage / after_stage / code_review

Split into three files because they grow for different reasons; wired with `#[path]` submodules
so the children reach the parent's private helpers via `use super::*` without widening visibility.

## Post-Tool Heartbeat

`loom-hooks/post-tool-use.sh` writes only private heartbeat metadata under `.loom/work/heartbeat/`. It does not persist tool names, commands, output, byte counts, or previews. This prevents credentials and private source printed by tools from becoming durable shared state.

The legacy `ToolEvent` reader remains able to consume an older `.loom/work/tool-events.jsonl`, but no production hook creates or appends that file. New stuck detection therefore relies on heartbeat/session liveness rather than tool-output heuristics. If event observability is restored, it must use a bounded no-follow Rust writer and metadata-only records.

## Status Command (commands/status/)

- `commands/status.rs` - Entry point; dispatches to 3 modes
- `commands/status/data/collector.rs` - `collect_status_data()` — loads stages, sessions, plan into `StatusData` (module root `commands/status/data/mod.rs` re-exports it)
- `commands/status/render/` - Renderers: `render_progress()`, `render_graph()`, `render_merge_status()`, `render_compact()`, `render_attention()`
- `commands/status/ui/` - TUI for `--live` mode (subscribes to daemon via IPC); entry point `commands/status/ui/tui/mod.rs` (`run_tui`)
- `commands/status/diagnostics.rs` - `check_directory_structure()`, `check_parsing_errors()` for `loom status validate` / `doctor`
- `commands/status/display/mod.rs` - `count_files()` helper
- `commands/status/merge_status.rs` - Merge section data
- `commands/status/validation.rs` - `validate_markdown_files()`, `validate_references()`

**3 display modes:**
