# Doctrine And Acceptance

> Doctrine grep traps, setup-line grants, completion rules

## An Acceptance Criterion That Greps One Phrase Proves Presence, Never Agreement (2026-07-28)

**What happened:** the no-verify doctrine ("BLOCK-A") had to appear identically on three
surfaces. At integration-verify time `loom-hooks/subagent-verify-guard.sh` carried a 15-line
_reconstruction_ while `orchestrator/signals/cache.rs` and `CLAUDE.md.template` carried the
authoritative 7-line block. **Every acceptance criterion passed**, because they all
`rg -qF` a single anchor phrase that both wordings happened to contain.

**Why:** presence of a substring says nothing about the rest of the text. N greps across N
surfaces still only prove N substrings exist, never that the surfaces agree.

**Prevention:** when the same block must exist verbatim on multiple surfaces, pin it with a
**cross-surface byte-equality test**, not with greps — `include_str!` each static surface,
call the generator for each runtime surface, and assert equality.

**Fix:** `loom/src/orchestrator/signals/tests_doctrine.rs`.

## A Checker That Enumerates Forbidden Strings Must Not Contain Them Contiguously (2026-07-28)

**What happened:** the new cross-surface test lists the _retired_ phrasing it greps for, and it
lives in `loom/src/orchestrator/signals/` — exactly the directory a plan criterion scanned for
that phrasing. Both the constant array and a doc comment quoting it matched, so the test tripped
the plan's own acceptance.

**Prevention:** build each forbidden literal with `concat!` so it never appears contiguously in
the source, and keep the forbidden text out of comments too. **Detection:** run the plan's own
greps against your new file before assuming it is inert.

## An Exception Must Live in Every Block That Gets COPIED (2026-07-28)

**What happened:** the integration-verify carve-out was written into the signal-level override,
which is addressed to the _main agent_ ("when you spawn a verifier, tell it to run the complete
suite"). But what an integration-verify main agent actually pasted into its verifier subagent's
prompt was the Rule 5 preamble from `CLAUDE.md.template` — which carried the doctrine with **no
exception**. The verifier therefore received "no full build, no full test suite" as its most
rule-shaped instruction.

**Prevention:** for each rule, ask **which surface is pasted verbatim into a subagent prompt**,
and check that the exception survives that paste. A doctrine's exception belongs in every block
that is copied, not only in the prose that explains it.

**Since 2026-09-19 the paste is a hook, not the orchestrator:** `loom-hooks/spawn-guard.sh` prepends
`loom-hooks/_subagent-preamble.txt` to every typed spawn whose prompt lacks the `PREAMBLE_LINE` first line
(loom-codex-forwarder and `codex:*` are excluded; an untyped spawn gets nothing), and the template
says "do not paste it yourself". The question moves with it: the surface that reaches the subagent is
now `_subagent-preamble.txt`, so an exception (integration-verify) must survive THERE.

## After Landing a Doctrine, Grep for the Phrasing It RETIRES (2026-07-28)

**What happened:** four subagents each landed the new doctrine correctly in their own territory,
while the phrasing it _replaces_ — "verifies its subtree", "DO write code, run tests",
"test results" — survived a line or two away in `cache.rs`, `format/sections.rs` and
`CLAUDE.md.template`, text nobody was assigned to touch. The enforcement layer shipped while
the guidance layer still instructed the blocked behaviour.

**Why:** acceptance criteria grep for the wording a change _introduces_. Nothing greps for the
wording it _removes_, so contradictions are invisible to the gate.

**Prevention:** after landing a doctrine, sweep the **entire** guidance surface for the retired
phrasing, not just for the new phrasing. A stage's own guidance files can contradict the
doctrine that stage is landing.

## Canonical Text Referenced by Plan Path Is Unreachable From a Worktree (SYSTEMIC, 2026-07-28)

**What happened:** two independent stages were told to copy canonical wording **verbatim from
`doc/plans/`**. Plan files live in the main repo working tree and are frequently uncommitted, so
they are absent from the worktree checkout, and `worktree-file-guard.sh` hard-blocks the
absolute main-repo path on `PreToolUse:Read`. One stage found a readable copy; the other
reconstructed the text from the single phrase pinned by an acceptance criterion, and the two
copies then drifted (see the first lesson on this page).

**Misleading signal:** the signal header claims "plan overview embedded below", but no overview
section is generated.

**Prevention (for plan authors):** any verbatim text a stage must reproduce — canonical wording,
message blocks, doctrine — **must be inlined into the stage description itself**, never
referenced by plan path. **Detection (for executing agents):** if the assignment says "copy
EXACTLY" and the text is not in your signal, you are already blocked — say so rather than
reconstructing.

## Acceptance Runs in the Stage's Sandbox, So a Gate Verified on the Host Strands a Finished Stage (2026-08-17)

**What happened:** `01-overlay-contract` finished its work, passed its own review, committed —
and then could not complete. Two of its acceptance criteria were unpassable inside a worktree
session and always had been. `cargo test --all-targets --no-fail-fast` pulls in the tmux e2e
suite, which cannot create an `AF_UNIX` socket under a session sandbox. And
`./target/debug/loom map --outline src/main.rs` opens `ContextStore`, which resolves its cache
under the MAIN project root — read-only from a worktree. Neither has anything to do with the
stage's diff.

**Why:** `loom stage complete` runs the acceptance list from the agent's own process, so every
criterion inherits the session sandbox. The daemon's host-side verification does not, which is
why the same list looks green from an operator shell. The plan author had confirmed the
`loom map` criterion by running it — in the main checkout, unsandboxed — and had written into
the same plan, correctly, that no `allow_write` line can grant those paths. The finding was
recorded as a caveat instead of disqualifying the command.

**Prevention:** run every acceptance command from a worktree under the stage's own sandbox
before it enters a plan, and record the observed baseline in the plan prose. Treat "this write
can never be granted" as a disqualification of the command, never a caveat to note beside it.
Environment-dependent tests get a self-skip guard rather than a place in any stage's gate.
Detection: a stage whose acceptance fails on files its diff never touched.

**Fix:** the agent cannot force completion and should not try — `--no-verify` needs a one-time
operator proof from `.loom/work/admin.token`, which the sandbox denies by design. But stopping is not
the whole move: **a stage agent that judges a criterion impossible rather than merely failing
should file `loom stage dispute-criteria <stage-id> --criterion-index <n> --reason "..."`**, which
routes through the daemon to adjudication and can amend the criterion via the audited
`apply_amendment` path. Operator-side, `loom stage amend <stage-id> --field acceptance --op
replace --index <n> --value '<cmd>'` reaches the same machinery directly for a stage that is not
currently executing. Reserve both for impossible criteria — a criterion that is merely red is a
defect to fix, not to amend away.

## Paths: working_dir Mismatch (Recurring)

**Mistake:** Acceptance criteria, artifact paths, and file checks used absolute paths like `loom/src/...` when `working_dir` was already `loom`, producing double-paths like `loom/loom/src/...`. Occurred in 5+ separate plans.
**Fix:** ALL paths in acceptance/artifacts/wiring/wiring_tests are relative to `working_dir`. If `working_dir: "loom"`, use `path/to/file.rs` not `loom/path/to/file.rs`. Set `working_dir` to where `Cargo.toml`/`package.json` lives.

## Stages: Marked Complete Without Implementation (Recurring)

**Mistake:** Multiple stages were marked Completed with no code committed. `stage_type: knowledge` auto-sets `merged=true` which masked missing work.
**Fix:** Always run acceptance criteria BEFORE marking stages complete. Verify actual artifacts exist.

## loom merge Command Removal

**Lesson:** `loom merge` duplicated `loom stage complete` functionality with 5 bugs. Removed entirely rather than fixing. When a command duplicates existing functionality and has multiple bugs, removal is better than repair.

## Truths → Acceptance Unification

**What happened:** truths and truth_checks were separate fields on StageDefinition/Stage that overlapped with acceptance criteria. Unified into AcceptanceCriterion enum (Simple|Extended).

**Gotcha:** Old plans with a top-level `truths:` field are now rejected as unknown instead of silently dropping the checks. Migrate those commands to `acceptance`; `before_stage` and `after_stage` remain valid delta-proof fields.

**How to avoid:** Keep plan structs strict with `deny_unknown_fields` so removed or misspelled policy cannot false-pass. When compatibility is required, use an explicit migration path rather than permissive deserialization.

## Stale Acceptance Criteria Referencing External Plan Files

**What happened:** An `integration-verify` stage had an acceptance criterion `cargo run -- plan verify ../doc/plans/DONE-PLAN-cwd-knowledge-resolution.md`. That plan file was deleted during housekeeping (`doc: remove completed plans`) AFTER the stage was authored but BEFORE it ran. The criterion failed at execution time with a file-not-found error, requiring `--no-verify` to complete.

**Why:** Plan files in `doc/plans/` are subject to archiving/deletion as a normal maintenance operation. A file that exists when you write a criterion may not exist when the stage executes, especially for long-running plans.

**Prevention:** When generating acceptance criteria for `integration-verify` stages, never reference plan files from `doc/plans/` directly. Instead, use self-contained fixtures: create a temp file via `TempDir` + `write_plan` in Rust tests (see `tests/integration/plan_verify.rs` for the pattern). If a live-CLI smoke test is needed, write a minimal inline plan to a temp path rather than relying on a file that may be archived.

**Fix:** Use test fixtures that are fully controlled by the test suite. Reference `tests/integration/plan_verify.rs` as the canonical example of building plan fixtures without touching `doc/plans/`.

## Aggregated Wiring Re-Verification: Double-Applied working_dir

**What happened:** `run_aggregated_wiring_reverification` in `commands/stage/complete.rs` was called with `acceptance_dir` (already resolved to `worktree_root + integration-verify.working_dir`) and then joined each prior stage's `working_dir` on top, producing paths like `loom/loom/src/...`. The wiring check reported "Wiring source file missing" for every prior stage.

**Why:** `acceptance_dir` is computed as `worktree_root + working_dir`, so it is already a fully resolved path. Joining another `working_dir` on top re-applies it.

**Prevention — Detection rule:** Any code path that loops over prior stages and builds a source-file path MUST start from `worktree_root`, then join the per-stage `working_dir`. Never start from an already-resolved `acceptance_dir`.

**Fix:** Changed call site to pass `worktree_root` (from `StageExecutionPaths`) through `run_verification_phase` into the aggregated re-verifier; each stage's `working_dir` is joined against the worktree root.

## Vendored slash-command / Codex skill must consume the plan arg verbatim (no `doc/plans/` prefix)

**What happened:** Originally-installed `pressure.md` / codex `SKILL.md` used `doc/plans/$1`, which double-prefixed into `doc/plans/doc/plans/PLAN-foo.md`.
**Why:** The `loom pressure` driver hands children the FULL repo-relative invocation (e.g. `doc/plans/PLAN-foo.md`) because they run with `current_dir(repo_root)`. The template then re-prefixed `doc/plans/`.
**Prevention:** When a Rust driver passes a repo-relative path to a slash command or Codex skill, the template MUST use `$1`/`<PLAN>` directly. The driver owns path resolution (`resolve_plan_path`); the template owns none.
**Fix:** vendored `commands/{pressure,address}.md` and `codex/skills/pressure/SKILL.md` use the arg verbatim.

## Gate path resolution on `is_file()`, not `exists()`, before spawning agents

**What happened:** Plan resolution risked accepting a directory argument.
**Why:** `Path::exists()` is true for directories; canonicalizing one and handing it to claude/codex fails confusingly downstream.
**Fix:** `resolve_plan_path` gates on `is_file()` so a directory arg fails cleanly at resolution.

## A `--dry-run` that hand-builds its command string drifts from the real spawn

**What happened:** An early dry-run printed simplified commands missing `--permission-mode`/`--model`/`-C`.
**Why:** Preview re-derived argv independently of the spawn path.
**Prevention/Fix:** share ONE argv builder between preview and spawn (`claude_args`/`codex_args` feed both `render_dry_run` and `spawn_*`). Any preview that re-derives argv is a silent-divergence hazard.

## Stage signal did not embed the plan's inline command/skill bodies

**What happened:** The implement-pressure signal omitted the plan's inline slash-command and codex-skill bodies. Canonical sources had to be recovered from `~/.claude/commands/*.md` (Read tool) and `~/.codex/skills/pressure/SKILL.md` (Bash `cat` — `worktree-file-guard.sh` ALLOWS the Read tool on `~/.claude/` but BLOCKS it on `~/.codex/`). The installed copies were also STALE.
**Prevention:** When a stage depends on file bodies that live outside the worktree, do not trust the signal to inline them or the installed copies to be current — recover from the authoritative source and treat installed versions as suspect.

## Plans-location rule was prose-only — the one hard rule with no hook enforcement (2026-07-06)

**What happened:** Opus repeatedly wrote plans to `~/.claude/plans/` despite CLAUDE.md.template stating the ban three times (Rule 1, a HARD STOP banner, and the end-of-file reminders).
**Why:** Plan mode injects its save-location suggestion at the moment of the Write call; a prohibition stated mid-file thousands of tokens earlier reliably loses to an instruction present at the decision point. Every other hard rule (commit/complete, git add -A, worktree isolation) had a hook backstop — plans did not: `worktree-file-guard.sh` exits early outside loom worktrees and explicitly whitelists all `~/.claude/**` paths, so interactive sessions (where plan mode runs) had zero deterministic coverage.
**Prevention:** A rule that must never be violated needs a deterministic channel, not more prose. Prose emphasis is also zero-sum — when ~20 rules carry ⛔/NEVER banners, the salience gradient is flat and the load-bearing rules don't stand out.
**Fix:** Added `loom-hooks/plans-path-guard.sh` (PreToolUse on Write|Edit, blocks `.claude/plans` and `.claude/projects/*/plans` path segments, exit-2 message redirects to `doc/plans/`), wired via `fs/permissions/constants.rs`, `fs/permissions/hooks.rs`, and `install.sh`. Restructured CLAUDE.md.template to a 5-item hard-stop tier stated verbatim at top and bottom.

## Delta-Proof `before_stage` Gate Re-Run on Every Re-Spawn Deadlocks the Stage (2026-07-27)

**What happened:** `start_stage` ran a stage's `before_stage` truth checks on _every_ spawn attempt. Those checks are delta-proofs — they assert the feature does NOT exist yet. After a session was interrupted mid-stage (leaving its implementation in the worktree/branch), orphan recovery re-queued the stage, the checks re-ran, found the feature present, and marked the stage `Blocked` with `FailureType::TestFailure` **before spawning any session**. Since no session ever ran, nothing could finish or commit the work, and `loom stage retry` / the next `loom run` reproduced the identical failure forever. The stage could not self-heal.

**Misleading signal:** the failure output is a genuine, correctly-computed check result — "this command exited 0 but the plan says it should exit 1" — so the block looks like a real pre-condition violation rather than the orchestrator tripping over its own prior progress. The comment on the call site ("verify pre-conditions in fresh worktree") described an assumption — a _fresh_ worktree — that `get_or_create_worktree` stops honoring the moment a stage is retried.

**Why:** a one-shot gate was placed on a path that runs many times. Every re-entry route into `start_stage` (orphan recovery → Queued, `loom stage retry`, crash auto-retry) reuses the same worktree and the same `loom/<stage-id>` branch, so the "before" state the check asserts is by construction no longer true after the first attempt.

**Prevention — detection rule:** any check whose _expected_ outcome changes once the stage does its work (delta-proofs, "feature absent" assertions, baseline captures) must be gated on evidence that no work exists yet — not merely placed before the spawn. Before adding a blocking check to a spawn path, ask what it does on attempt #2. And a blocking transition that happens _before_ a session is spawned deserves extra scrutiny: nothing downstream can clear it, so a wrong block is permanent, not merely slow.

**Fix:** `stage_executor.rs::before_stage_gate_passed` calls `verify::before_after::find_prior_stage_work` first and skips the checks (logging the evidence) when the stage branch has commits beyond its resolved base or the worktree has non-scaffold changes. Loom's own worktree scaffolding (`.loom/work`, `.claude/`, root `CLAUDE.md`) is discounted via `git::worktree::is_worktree_scaffold_path` — otherwise, in a repo that doesn't gitignore those, the very first spawn would look "dirty" and silently disable the gate. Note `git::has_uncommitted_changes` excludes untracked files and was useless here (a brand-new module is untracked); `list_working_tree_changes` was added for the "has anyone worked here?" question.

## Stage Fragmentation: Compile-Order Is Not a Stage Boundary (2026-08-07)

**What happened:** the most common loom plan-authoring error is splitting ONE cohesive feature into
one stage per architectural layer (schema → runtime → doctrine → tests) because each layer imports
the one before it. This plan deliberately did not: the whole codex-implementer feature shipped as a
SINGLE standard stage between the knowledge/integration-verify bookends, with a foundation edit
followed by parallel subagents over disjoint files.

**Why:** "B imports A" is a COMPILE-ORDER dependency, and one stage resolves it for free by writing
A first — that is a foundation step, not a stage boundary. Only a MERGE-ORDER dependency is a real
boundary: the dependent work must run against _merged, gate-passed_ code. Each extra stage costs a
worktree, a session, a merge, and a FULL re-run of the acceptance gate.

**Prevention (detection rule):** if a plan has one stage per architectural layer of a single feature
and their `files:` sets are DISJOINT, it is fragmented — merge them. Disjoint file sets are evidence
_for_ merging (parallel subagents can own them), not against it. `/loom-plan-writer` now enforces
this: the Stage Necessity Test (`skills/loom-plan-writer/SKILL.md:388`) requires every non-bookend
stage to name which of Q1-Q4 forced it, the validation checklist re-checks that at `:825`, and
`:771` states outright that a compile-order dependency is a foundation step, not a stage split. A
stage that cannot cite a question is fragmentation.

**Fix:** one stage, foundation edit first, then fan out. Derive the foundation sweep from
`cargo build`, never from the plan's hand-counted file table — in execution the foundation step had
to fix three `Stage` struct literals, not the one the plan named, before fan-out could compile.

## Premature Stage Completion and Deadline Takeovers (2026-08-14)

**What happened:** Stages ran `loom stage complete` while subagents were still out or defects
unfixed, then kept working past completion — post-completion edits are lost because the merge
starts from the completed commit. Separately, orchestrators treated the 300s bounded-check
cadence as a deadline on subagent work and took over or re-spawned live subagents, duplicating
work already paid for.
**Why:** The Stop hook (commit-guard.sh) fires during subagent waits and read as "commit and
complete NOW"; CLAUDE.md Rule 6 said "on the deadline branch: take the work over"; no surface
said completion requires a settled stage or that completion is terminal.
**Prevention:** `loom-hooks/stage-terminal-guard.sh` blocks Write/Edit/Task/Agent in a worktree whose
stage is already completed/verified. Settled-state completion doctrine lives in
CLAUDE.md.template (hard stop 3, Rule 4), skills/loom-orchestration/SKILL.md (Rule 4, where the three commit conditions now live; template Rule 6 only points at the skill), `append_completion_rules()` in
`signals/cache.rs`, the budget-exceeded recitation box, and the commit-guard message; retired
takeover phrases are pinned in `tests_doctrine.rs::RETIRED_PHRASES`.
**Fix:** Complete only a settled stage (subagents absorbed, defects fixed, tree clean) and run
nothing after `loom stage complete`; re-arm bounded checks on live subagents and take over only
on positive evidence of death.

## A `setup` Line Cannot Create a Sandbox Grant (2026-09-13)

A path in `sandbox.filesystem.allow_write` is bound only if it already exists on the host when the
session starts. A stage `setup` command such as `mkdir -p /tmp/<dir>` for that path runs inside the
same sandbox: if the directory is missing it fails with `Read-only file system`, and if it exists
it does nothing. The line can only hurt, and because setup is prepended to every criterion it takes
all of them down with it.

**Corrected 2026-09-19:** this section used to end "create the directory on the host before the
stage's session starts and record that prerequisite in the plan prose". A prose prerequisite was
missed by the next plan (`PLAN-loom-efficiency-and-acceptance`, four stalled stages), and the
directory is never needed: the stage sandbox already sets `$TMPDIR` to a writable directory outside
the repository. Drop the grant, the `TMPDIR=` override and the `setup` line. `loom plan verify`
rejects all three, plus any absolute grant missing on the host and any `mkdir`, `touch` or output
redirect aimed outside the worktree (`loom/src/plan/schema/host_paths.rs`,
`loom/src/plan/schema/host_paths/commands.rs`).

**Recurrence and the two fixes that shipped (2026-09-19):** four stages of one plan (`hook-guards`,
`knowledge-hygiene`, `plan-verification`, `retrieval-and-measurement`) each started with every
acceptance criterion failing `mkdir: Read-only file system` on a `TMPDIR=/tmp/loom-efficiency-checks`
grant that did not exist on the host, and each spent a session diagnosing it. Detection is the same
every time: every criterion fails at once with `Read-only file system` on the plan's own allow_write
path. The fix lives in surfaces that ship, not in this repository's prose or in the daemon: `loom plan
verify` rejects an absent or ephemeral absolute grant (`plan/schema/host_paths.rs`), and the stage
signal's sandbox section lists each grant missing at spawn under "Missing on the host, so NOT
writable this session" (`signals/generate.rs` `missing_allow_write_from_merged`,
`signals/format/sandbox_section.rs`). Do NOT make the daemon create the missing directory: a
fix for a loom behaviour must ship in the binary, `skills/`, `CLAUDE.md.template` or `loom-hooks/`
(a rule in this repository's knowledge tree reaches only this repository, and loom's users build
other projects), and it must not widen what the daemon writes on the host.

## A Finished Plan Was Committed Under an Ignored `DONE-` Name (2026-09-13)

**What happened:** with the run state already cleared, the harden-pre-commit-partial-staging
plan's `IN_PROGRESS-` file was renamed by hand with `git mv` to its `DONE-` name and committed
(`85dadb26`). `.gitignore:80` ignores `doc/plans/DONE-*`: finished plans are kept on disk, not in
git. `git mv` tracks its destination whatever the ignore rules say, so this became the repository's
only tracked `DONE-` plan.

**Prevention:** before `git mv` or `git add` puts a path under version control, run
`git check-ignore -v <path>`. To finish a plan by hand, remove the tracked path from git and rename
the file on disk.

**Fix:** a follow-up commit stopped tracking the `DONE-` file; it stays on disk.

## An Agent Doc May Only Name Commands Its Guard Allows (2026-09-13)

**What happened:** job-lifecycle's `agents/loom-codex-forwarder.md` told a backgrounded forwarder
to run `loom subagents wait --receipt` or `loom subagents watch`. `codex-forward-guard.sh`
authorizes only the exact wrapper argv plus one forward per transcript, so every such call was
blocked. In the same plan a fix brief told a worker to assert that no agent definition declares
`maxTurns`; three agent files declare `maxTurns: 150`, so the test failed against the correct tree.

**Why:** the doc and the guard were edited by different units, and nothing tests a doc's commands
against its guard. The brief read "no forced maxTurns reduction" as "no maxTurns key" without
looking at the tree.

**Prevention:**

- Every command an agent doc tells a guarded agent to run must pass that agent's guard; grep the
  doc's backticked commands against the guard's allowlist.
- Before briefing a pinning test, `rg` the value in the tree. A no-reduction invariant pins the
  current value as a floor.

**Fix:** IV rewrote the forwarder doc: a backgrounded forwarder makes no further tool call, and the
orchestrator recovers via the exact receipt (`agents/loom-codex-forwarder.md:54-62`).

## A Feature Carved Out of a Plan Still Owns Its User Docs (2026-09-16)

**What happened:** asked to implement "just the web host parameterisation" slice of a larger plan
(whose final knowledge-distill stage had been dropped from the request), the orchestrator shipped
and committed `--host` with no README, CHANGELOG or knowledge update, then reported docs as out of
scope because the plan had assigned them to its final distillation stage. The README still said the
dashboard was a `127.0.0.1`-only, unauthenticated tool, so it was wrong the moment the feature merged.

**Why:** the plan's ownership split (docs belong to knowledge-distill) was applied to a request that
dropped that stage. Removing the stage removed the only owner of the docs; nothing moved them back
into the carved-out scope.

**Prevention:** when a request keeps one slice of a plan, the slice inherits every deliverable the
dropped stages owned for it: user docs, CHANGELOG, stale knowledge sections. Grep the docs for the
changed flag or behaviour (`rg -- '--web|127\.0\.0\.1' README.md doc/`) before calling it done, and
put the doc edits in the implementation brief.

**Fix:** a follow-up docs pass updated README, CHANGELOG and the web-dashboard / web-terminal topics.
