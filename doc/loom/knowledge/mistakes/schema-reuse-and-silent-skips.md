## `deny_unknown_fields` on a Type With TWO Deserialization Sources Broke the Second One (2026-08-17)

**What happened:** every `.work/stages/*.md` file failed to parse. `loom run` printed one
`Warning: Could not parse ... Failed to parse StageDefinition from frontmatter` per stage
and carried on. `StageDefinition` is `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` — added in
`2d5a4679` to reject typo'd keys in PLAN YAML, which is a good guarantee for that caller.
But the same type was also being deserialized from a second, entirely different source:
stage files, whose frontmatter is a full serialized `Stage` carrying runtime-only keys
(`status`, `merged`, `fix_attempts`, `resolved_base`, `session`, `worktree`, …). Strictness
that is correct for the plan is fatal for the stage file, and nobody noticed the type had
two readers.

**The stale comment was the tell.** `fs/stage_loading.rs`'s module doc still asserted the
premise the attribute had invalidated — "serde ignores the runtime-only keys (`status`,
`created_at`, `merged`, …)". A doc comment stating a serde behaviour is load-bearing
documentation: when an attribute changes that behaviour, the comment becomes a false claim
that reads as reassurance.

**Prevention:** before adding `deny_unknown_fields` (or any strictness attribute) to a
type, enumerate every `from_*`/`parse` call site that deserializes INTO it. If there is
more than one source and they carry different key sets, the attribute belongs on a
per-source type, not the shared one. The fix here parses the frontmatter as the type the
file actually holds (`Stage`) and projects down via `definition_from_stage`, so
`StageDefinition` keeps its plan-YAML guarantee untouched.

**Keep the projection compiler-enforced.** `definition_from_stage` is a struct literal with
NO `..Default::default()`, so adding a field to `StageDefinition` fails the build until the
projection is updated. This is deliberate: an earlier hand-rolled partial struct silently
dropped `stage_type`, `auto_merge`, `sandbox`, `context_budget` and
`before_stage`/`after_stage` on every daemon restart. Never reintroduce a spread or a
hand-maintained key allowlist here — both fail silently, which is the whole bug.

## Warn-and-Continue Turns Total Failure Into an Empty Result

`load_stages_from_work_dir` handled a parse error by `eprintln!`-ing a warning and
`continue`-ing to the next file. With every file failing, it returned `Ok(vec![])` — a
successful empty load. Its production caller is the documented recovery path in
`plan/graph/loader.rs` ("Stage files in .work/stages/ can be used instead of the plan
file"), so that fallback could never have worked; it would have produced an empty graph
rather than an error.

**Prevention:** a per-item skip is only safe when *some* items are expected to succeed. When
a loop skips EVERY item, that is a total failure wearing a success type. Either fail loudly
when the skip count equals the item count, or make the caller distinguish "no stage files"
from "no stage file parsed". A warning printed once per file is not a substitute — it
scrolls past in daemon output and nothing downstream can act on it.

**Test fixtures encode assumptions too.** Five pre-existing tests hand-wrote minimal,
plan-shaped frontmatter and asserted it parsed — the exact assumption the bug was made of.
They passed for as long as the bug existed. When a fix makes old fixtures fail, check
whether the fixture or the code was wrong before "repairing" the fixture; here the fixtures
were, and were rebuilt to serialize a real `Stage`.

## An Exit Code That Also Means "Some Files Were Unreadable" (2026-08-27)

**What happened:** duplicate detection and wiring detection had been silently reporting
"nothing found" under every sandbox, while passing. Both shell out to `grep -r … .` from the
worktree root and treated exit code 2 as fatal — dump stderr, discard stdout, return empty.

**Why:** grep exits 2 when ANY file under the search root is unreadable, **even when the search
succeeded and stdout holds real matches**. Verified on the host:

```text
grep -r -n "needle" .    →  good.txt:1:needle here   exit=2   stderr: Permission denied
grep -s -r -n "needle" . →  good.txt:1:needle here   exit=2   stderr: (empty)
```

Note the second line: `-s` suppresses the messages but **the exit code is still 2**. Silencing
the noise alone would have hidden the flood and left the false PASS in place.

Sandboxed stages have ~20 read-denied paths at the project root
(`mistakes/sandbox-and-settings.md`), so exit 2 was the normal case, not the exception. The
same handler also `eprintln!`-ed the whole stderr blob: one integration-verify stage emitted
1344 lines / 59.8KB, which pushed the completion command's output past the harness persist
threshold and cost the stage its verification marker
(`mistakes/completion-broker-credential.md`).

**Prevention:**

- **Ask what a non-zero exit actually asserts.** An exit code that conflates "I failed" with "I
  partially succeeded" cannot be used as a control-flow signal. Read the tool's documented exit
  semantics before branching on them; here the stdout was always authoritative.
- **This is the sibling of "warn-and-continue" above.** There a per-item skip turned total
  failure into an empty success; here an exit code did. Both present as a thinner result, never
  as an error, and both passed their tests for as long as the bug existed.
- **A subprocess's stderr is unbounded input.** Never `eprintln!` it verbatim into output that
  something downstream parses or truncates. Cap it by lines and bytes.
- **Test the degraded environment, not just the happy one.** The regression tests build a tree
  containing a `0o000` file and assert the match is still found — and skip loudly (rather than
  passing vacuously) where permission bits are not enforced, e.g. under root.
