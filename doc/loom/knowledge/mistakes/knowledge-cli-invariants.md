# Knowledge Cli Invariants

> Invariants live in the fs constructor

## A CLI Handler Is Rarely the Only Caller of the Constructor It Guards (2026-07-28)

**What happened:** "new projects start hierarchical" was implemented only in
`commands::knowledge::init()`. But `loom init`, `loom map`, the (now-deleted) `knowledge
bootstrap`, and the implicit init inside `knowledge update` all called `KnowledgeDir::initialize()`
**directly** and bypassed that handler. Every new project was therefore born flat and, at the
time, nagged to run the also-deleted `loom knowledge gc`. The `cli-collapse` later removed both
verbs — the CLI now has only `update`, `context`, `sync` — but the underlying invariant fix below
is unaffected by that collapse.

**Prevention:** when a CLI handler establishes an invariant about on-disk layout, grep for the
underlying filesystem constructor (`rg 'initialize\(\)'`) — the handler is rarely the only
caller. Put the invariant in the constructor.

**Fix:** capture `let fresh = !self.root.exists()` at the top of `initialize()` and write the
index only when fresh — which also preserves the deliberate rule that existing flat directories
are never auto-migrated.

## Writes That Must Refresh a Sibling File Deadlock If Done Inside the Lock (2026-07-28)

**What happened:** `fs/locking.rs` locks a file's **parent directory**, not the file. `INDEX.md`
and every tier-1 file share `doc/loom/knowledge/` as their parent, so regenerating the index
from inside `locked_read_modify_write` requests a second exclusive lock on a directory the same
thread already holds. `flock` is per open file description — it blocks forever.

**Prevention:** any write that must also refresh a sibling file in the same directory has to do
it **after** the locked call returns, never inside the closure. Documented at
`fs/knowledge/dir.rs::refresh_index_if_hierarchical`. (Tier-2 writes lock
`<root>/<category>/`, a different directory, so they do not collide.)

## `loom knowledge update` Appends — a Retry Duplicates the Block (2026-07-28)

**What happened / why:** `update` is append-only by design. The `INDEX.md` refresh that follows a
successful write is deliberately **non-fatal** (it warns to stderr and returns `Ok`) precisely so
that a refresh failure does not make a successful write exit non-zero — an agent's natural retry
would then append the same block twice.

**Prevention:** `update` ALWAYS appends, so never use it to fix an existing section — that is what
`loom knowledge replace-section <file> "<heading>" "<body>"` is for (restored 2026-08-19 after the
CLI collapse had removed it; `cli/types_memory.rs`, `commands/knowledge/mod.rs::replace_section`).
It overwrites the body under the first matching heading at ANY level `##` through `######`
(replace-section is NOT H2-only — an earlier note here said it was), replacing up to the next
heading at the same or shallower level, and appends — announcing that it did — when no heading
matches at any level, so read its output: an appended "correction" means the heading did not
match and the stale text is still in the file. A zero exit code does not prove `INDEX.md` is
current — watch stderr, and finish any batch of knowledge writes with `loom knowledge sync`, which
regenerates the index unconditionally.

## Verify a Prefix-Matching Claim Before "Fixing" It (2026-07-28)

**What happened:** a reviewer flagged `find_oversized_sections` for conflating H3 with H2.
It does not: `"### Foo".starts_with("## ")` is **false** — the third character is `#`, not a
space. Matching on `"## "` is correct for H2-only detection and lets an H2 section span its H3
subsections.

**Prevention:** verify a prefix-matching claim with an actual assertion before changing code to
satisfy it. Pinned by a regression test under `fs/knowledge/tests/` (the standalone
`fs/knowledge/tests_gc.rs` module this was originally pinned in no longer exists — that
gc-era test file was folded into the current `tests/` module tree).

## `str::lines()` on a Trailing-Newline String Adds No Empty Element (2026-07-28)

`"# T\n\n> B\n\nbody\n".lines().count()` is **5**, not 4. Watch for this off-by-one when
asserting a `TopicEntry.line_count` or any GC line-count metric against a hand-written literal.

## Deleting Public Items in a Foundation Step Breaks the Crate for the Whole Fan-Out (2026-07-28)

**What happened:** a stage's foundation step removed public constants that parallel subagents'
files still referenced, so the crate stopped compiling for the duration of the fan-out. It looks
like a broken worktree; it is not.

**Prevention:** pin the exact new API signatures in **every** subagent prompt and tell each
worker to ignore compiler errors outside its owned files — otherwise a worker "fixes" another
worker's file and work is lost. The main agent is the only one that verifies a green build.

## replace-section Swallows the Subsections Under the Heading It Replaces (2026-09-06)

**What happened:** `loom knowledge replace-section entry-points/hooks.md "Hook Scripts — What Each Does" "<table>"` was run to add one row to that heading's table. The section ran from the `##` heading to the next `##`, so the two `###` subsections beneath it (`loom-hooks/_common.sh Helpers`, `Registration Sites for a New Hook`) and a closing paragraph — 36 lines — were replaced along with the table. The command reported a clean "Replaced".

**Why:** a section is everything up to the next heading of the same or a higher level (`fs/knowledge/splice.rs`), so a `##` heading owns its `###` children. The caller supplied only the table body it had read, and nothing warns when the replacement is far shorter than what it displaces.

**Prevention:** before `replace-section`, run `rg -n '^#{2,6} ' <file>` and check whether any deeper heading sits between the target and the next same-level heading. If one does, either target the deepest heading that contains only the text you mean to change, or include the child sections verbatim in the replacement body. Compare `git diff --stat` on the file afterwards: a large net deletion from a one-row edit is the tell.

**Fix:** restored the file from HEAD and re-applied the single row with an editor.

full content.)

## loom knowledge update: Path Resolution

**Mistake:** Running `loom knowledge update` from a subdirectory creates files relative to cwd, not worktree root.
**Fix:** Always run knowledge commands from the worktree root.

## Knowledge Commands: CWD Resolution (2026-04-16)

**What happened:** Knowledge commands used `main_project_root()` which followed `.loom/work` symlinks to resolve to the main repo root. In worktree contexts (e.g., integration-verify stages), `loom knowledge update` wrote to the main repo instead of the worktree, causing cross-worktree state pollution.
**Why:** `main_project_root()` was designed to always find the true main repo root, which was correct for `.loom/work/` state but wrong for knowledge files that should be worktree-local.
**Prevention:** Use `project_root()` (cwd-relative) for file writes that should respect worktree isolation. Use `main_project_root()` only for accessing shared state (`.loom/work/`). Always run `loom knowledge update` from the worktree root, not a subdirectory.
**Fix:** Replaced all `main_project_root()` calls in knowledge commands and map.rs with `project_root()`. Updated signal content to require commits for knowledge stages. Removed commit-guard.sh bypass for knowledge stages.

## A Historical/Example Marker Must Share Its Physical Markdown Line With the Backtick It Classifies (2026-09-10)

`classify_reference` (`loom/src/fs/knowledge/chunker/references.rs:44-60`) judges a backticked
path from its `sentence_window`, and that window is built per physical source line
(`references_in` iterates `body.split_inclusive('\n')`) — a marker on the wrapped PREVIOUS line
is invisible even though the prose reads as one sentence. Two specific traps:

- The historical marker `is_there_is_no_this_path` (references.rs:110-112) only fires on the
  exact substring `` there is no `<path>` `` — a sentence like "there is no top-level module and
  no `path/to/file.rs` either" does not qualify; the backtick must follow "there is no"
  immediately.
- Wrapping a sentence so the marker phrase and the backtick land on different source lines
  drops the reference to `Live`/`MissingSourceRef` even though it reads correctly across the
  wrap.

Already fixed (verify before re-reporting either as a bug): `is_sentence_end`
(references.rs:246-253) now excludes dots that are inside backticks or end an
`e.g./i.e./vs./cf.` abbreviation, and `sentence_window`'s `mask_other_spans` blanks OTHER
backtick spans' contents within the window instead of cutting the window at them — a sentence
citing several example paths (e.g., `01-a.md`, `02-b.md`) classifies every one of them
correctly now.

Prevention: keep a historical or example marker phrase and its backticked path on the same
source line, and phrase "there is no" immediately before the backtick.

## Stage Sandbox Denies Writes to `.loom/cache` (2026-09-17)

Inside a stage worktree session, `loom knowledge context` prints `warning: failed to refresh
the context cache (Failed to write context catalog: <repo>/.loom/cache/context-v1/catalog.json);
using an in-memory catalog` because `.loom/cache` sits outside the stage's `allow_write` set.
The query still answers correctly from the in-memory catalog rebuilt for that call -- this is a
sandbox limit, not a knowledge-command defect. Do not treat the warning as a reason to widen the
sandbox or to distrust the returned context.
