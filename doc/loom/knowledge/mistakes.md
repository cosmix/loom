## Edited installed hook instead of source

**What:** Edited `~/.claude/hooks/loom/skill-trigger.sh` instead of `hooks/skill-trigger.sh` in the project.

**Why:** Followed settings.json path directly to installed file without considering source/install separation.

**Avoid:** Always edit hooks in project's `hooks/` directory. Installed copies (`~/.claude/hooks/loom/`) get overwritten on reinstall.
