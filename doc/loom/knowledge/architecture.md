## Project Overview

Loom is a Rust CLI (~15K lines) for orchestrating parallel Claude Code sessions across git worktrees. It enables concurrent task execution with automatic crash recovery, context handoffs, and progressive merging.

## Directory Structure

Full `loom/src/` module tree, `.loom/work/` state layout, repo-root asset directories.

→ [Directory Structure](architecture/directory-structure.md)

## Core Abstractions

`ExecutionGraph`, `Stage`, `Session`, `Orchestrator`, `TerminalBackend`, `KnowledgeDir`, data flow, `.loom/work/` file ownership.

→ [Core Abstractions, Data Flow & File Ownership](architecture/core-abstractions.md)

## Worktree Isolation (4-Layer Defense)

→ [Worktree Isolation & Security](architecture/security-and-isolation.md)

## Context Budget Enforcement

`context_ceiling_tokens` — an ABSOLUTE resident-token ceiling, resolved stage -> project `[context]` -> user `~/.loom/config.toml` `[context]` -> default, enforced at three independent thresholds (1.0x hook, 1.25x daemon, 1.5x native compaction).

## `loom pressure` Command (Plan Pressure-Testing Driver)

→ [Remote Control Module § loom pressure Command](architecture/remote-control.md)

## Tiered Knowledge Base (`fs/knowledge/`, `commands/knowledge/`)

Two-tier curated knowledge: generated `INDEX.md`, tier-1 summary files, and tier-2 topics at
`<category>/<slug>.md`. Layout is `Hierarchical` **iff** `INDEX.md` exists. Covers module split,
target parsing, index generation, the `catalog::build` diagnostics (duplicate heading, generic
blurb, broken link, missing source ref), opt-in migration, and lock ordering.

→ [Knowledge Hierarchy](architecture/knowledge-hierarchy.md)

## `loom knowledge bootstrap` (Operator Command)

Rebuilds `doc/loom/knowledge/` from scratch in a repo not managed by loom plans: a deterministic
host phase (scaffold, refresh, directory clusters with content digests) followed by an
interactive Claude session that writes only through `loom knowledge`, then a committed receipt
(`doc/loom/knowledge/.bootstrap-receipt.json`) that makes `--refresh` incremental and idempotent.

→ [Knowledge Bootstrap](architecture/knowledge-bootstrap.md)

## Codex Plugin (openai-codex) [DETAILED]

Marketplace install/scope, the `loom-codex-forwarder` lane, per-stage `implementers`, sonnet fallback.

→ [Codex Plugin](architecture/codex-plugin.md)

## Codex Concurrency [DETAILED]

Foreground fan-out verified safe to 6 concurrent codex-companion tasks; background fan-out ruled out.

→ [Codex Concurrency](architecture/codex-concurrency.md)

## Terminal Backends: SessionBackend / TmuxBackend [DETAILED]

`SessionBackend` dispatches every spawn/kill/liveness call to a `Native` or opt-in `Tmux` lane, recorded on `Session.backend`.

→ [Terminal Backends](architecture/terminal-backends.md)

## Context Retrieval (`loom/src/context/`)

Deterministic, model-free, network-free retrieval over the curated knowledge hierarchy: chunk the prose (curated plus indexed project prose under `doc/`), rank per channel, fuse by **two-tier fusion** (exact-rung candidates first by raw score, the lexical remainder by reciprocal-rank fusion — NOT plain RRF), pack to a token budget. One entry point — `context::retrieve_for_stage` — serves the `loom knowledge context`/`loom knowledge eval` commands, signal generation and the prompt hook alike. Two graphs exist — the knowledge-chunk catalog and the tree-sitter source graph — and both are ranked and fused into one pack, each through a persistent per-revision BM25 index behind the full scan (the scan stays the correctness oracle).

Full detail: [architecture/context-retrieval.md](architecture/context-retrieval.md); the base/overlay layering rule and what is derived versus durable are in [architecture/context-retrieval-state.md](architecture/context-retrieval-state.md), and the stopwording, BM25 index and prose corpus in [architecture/context-retrieval-corpus.md](architecture/context-retrieval-corpus.md).

## Source Graph (`loom/src/context/source_graph/`, `context/extract/`)

A derived tree-sitter graph of the repo's own source, with two live consumers:
`loom map` (via `context::graph_store`) and the `Source` retrieval channel,
ranked by `context::rank_source` (`context/rank_source.rs:154`) and fused into the
same `ContextPack` as knowledge chunks. Its defining property is an explicit
honesty contract: every edge carries provenance and a confidence ceiling, and no
file is ever silently omitted — a degraded file is reported as degraded.

Extractor trait, cache identity, coverage contract, the ranker and the
publish/reconcile lifecycle: [architecture/source-graph.md](architecture/source-graph.md).

## Execution Containment (`loom/src/verify/criteria/confine.rs`)

Plan-authored commands run through `spawn_confined` — environment scrubbing, not isolation.

→ [Execution Containment](architecture/execution-containment.md)

## Memory Spool and Drain (`fs/memory/spool.rs`, `orchestrator/core/spool_drain.rs`) [DETAILED]

A sandboxed stage cannot write `.loom/work/memory/<stage>.md` — `.loom/work` is a symlink out of the
worktree and the sandbox grants no `Edit` there — so `loom memory` appends to
`<worktree>/.loom/memory-spool.jsonl` instead and the daemon drains it each tick, plus once
more in `cleanup_after_merge` before the worktree is destroyed. The payload carries **no
stage id**: attribution comes from which worktree an entry was drained from, which an agent
cannot forge.

Why the allowlist could not simply be widened, the drain invariants that are easy to break,
and the read-path merge: [architecture/memory-spool.md](architecture/memory-spool.md).

## Telemetry (`loom/src/telemetry/`)

→ [Signal Generation Pipeline § Telemetry](architecture/signal-generation.md)

## Quota Poller

A daemon thread (`loom/src/quota/poller.rs`) polls the Claude OAuth usage endpoint and `codex app-server` every 180 s and caches one `ProviderQuota` per provider under `.loom/work/quota/`; `StatusData.quota` is read from that cache, never polled, and rendered in the `--live` and `--web` footers. Sources, backoff, cache hygiene, and the token-handling rules: [architecture/quota-poller.md](architecture/quota-poller.md).

## Web Dashboard

`loom status --web [PORT] [--host HOST]` serves an embedded React SPA over HTTP/WebSocket, streaming the same `StatusData` the live TUI renders; a non-loopback `--host` bind requires the printed startup token on every route.

→ [Web Dashboard](architecture/web-dashboard.md)

## Token Accounting and Receipts [DETAILED]

`loom usage` provider ledger and `--compare`, the certified criterion cache, forward/read/worker-brief receipt lifecycles, exact waits and their hook phases: [architecture/token-accounting-and-receipts.md](architecture/token-accounting-and-receipts.md).

## Owned Subagent Waits

`loom subagents watch/wait` bind an explicit `--worker claude:<id>`/`--worker codex:<unit-id>` set once per session, replacing an unbound `--timeout`-only poll. Trusted completion writers separately HMAC-sign completion evidence with a host-only key, closing a forgery path through sandbox-writable `handoffs/`; `Session.exit_reason` is independent from `SessionStatus`. See [Owned Waits](architecture/owned-waits.md) and [Completion Recovery](architecture/completion-recovery.md).

## Typed Config Values (`ConfigValue` Read-Path Seam)

Typed value read-path replacing the old stringly `UserConfig::value_of`. See [Typed Config Values](architecture/config-value-types.md).
