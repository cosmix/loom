## Doctrine Block Cross-Surface Pinning

A **doctrine block** is a fixed chunk of agent guidance that must appear byte-identically on
several surfaces at once — a runtime signal prefix, a static template, and a hook's refusal
message. As of the doctrine-surfaces stage, loom carries three named, positively-pinned blocks
(there is no `BLOCK_D` in the tree today — an assignment or brief that says "four" is counting a
different thing, most likely the RETIRED_PHRASES sweep below as a fourth mechanism):

| Block     | Content                                                                          | Const location                                   | Pinning test(s)                                                                                              |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BLOCK_A` | "VERIFICATION IS THE MAIN AGENT'S JOB — NOT YOURS" (subagent no-verify rule)      | `orchestrator/signals/tests_doctrine.rs:80`       | `tests_doctrine.rs` asserts `text.contains(BLOCK_A)` on every guidance surface                                  |
| `BLOCK_B` | Model allocation / delegation ladder, incl. `CODEX_IMPLEMENTER_MODEL_TERRA`/`_LUNA`/`_EFFORT` | `orchestrator/signals/tests_doctrine.rs:92`       | same file; also asserts `BLOCK_B.contains(...)` for each codex identifier constant, so a renamed codex tier fails here first |
| `BLOCK_C` | Subagent one-background-watch / bounded-wait doctrine ("Checking on subagents...")| `orchestrator/signals/tests_doctrine_waiting.rs:35` | `tests_doctrine_waiting.rs::block_c_names_only_the_frozen_subagents_cli_surface` and friends                    |

`CLAUDE.md.template` is `include_str!`'d into both `tests_doctrine.rs` and `tests_doctrine_waiting.rs` (and `tests_doctrine_prefixes.rs`, which separately pins the four stable-prefix generators' byte ceilings — see [signal-generation.md](../architecture/signal-generation.md)) so a change to the template is checked against all three blocks and every generated signal in one pass.

The failure mode is drift, and it is invisible to ordinary acceptance criteria: greping each
surface for an anchor phrase proves only that a substring exists on each, never that the
surfaces agree. Two independently-worded copies both pass.

**The pattern:**

1. **One authority, and the orchestrator writes the foundation text first.** Exactly one surface
   is canonical — CLAUDE.md.template for a rule, or the stage's own brief for a stage-scoped
   change. When a new mandated rule directly contradicts an existing pinned block (real example:
   a stage brief mandated ONE background `loom subagents watch --timeout 3600`, which contradicted
   `BLOCK_C`'s old `(deadline <=300s ...)` parenthetical and its "re-arm and keep waiting" case),
   the fix is to REWORD the pinned block to agree with the new rule — never to leave the block
   byte-frozen and let it contradict live doctrine, and never to have a subagent freelance new
   foundation text. Reconcile *toward* the authoritative source, and update every pinning test's
   asserted needles to match the reworded block, keeping only the substrings that must survive.
2. **Pin with equality, not greps.** A single test `include_str!`s each static surface, calls
   the generator for each runtime surface, and asserts byte equality (or, for `BLOCK_B`,
   substring containment of the identifiers it must carry) against the canonical block. See
   `loom/src/orchestrator/signals/tests_doctrine.rs` and `tests_doctrine_waiting.rs`.
3. **Exceptions travel with the copied block.** For every rule ask: *which surface is pasted
   verbatim into a subagent prompt?* Any carve-out must survive that paste. A carve-out that
   lives only in the prose explaining the rule never reaches the agent that needs it.
4. **Frame outside the block.** Surface-specific framing (a hook's `BLOCKED:` header line,
   language-specific examples) sits *outside* the pinned block so the block itself stays
   byte-identical everywhere.
5. **Sweep for retired phrasing with a NEGATIVE pin, not a memory of the grep.** `RETIRED_PHRASES`
   in `tests_doctrine.rs` is asserted absent from `guidance_surfaces()` — CLAUDE.md.template +
   `skills/loom-plan-writer/SKILL.md` + every `agents/*.md` + `generate_stable_prefix()`'s
   generated text — so retiring a phrase from the canonical block is checked, not just remembered.
   `hooks/` is NOT covered by `guidance_surfaces()` — a retired phrase can still live on in a hook's
   own prose (e.g. `hooks/spawn-guard.sh`'s literal `PREAMBLE_LINE` constant), so a doctrine
   retirement must ALSO `rg` `hooks/` by hand.

**Known tradeoff:** because the blocks must stay byte-identical, per-language examples cannot
live inside them. `BLOCK_A` carries one Rust example, so a blocked Python or Go subagent reads a
`cargo` example. The fix is to append language examples *after* the block as explicitly
surface-local guidance.

## Ambiguity = Fail Safe (Privilege Lookups From State Files)

Any hook or gate that grants a **relaxation** by reading a `.work/` state file must treat more
than one candidate match as ambiguous and refuse. Concretely: resolve by glob, count the
matches, and consult the file **only when exactly one exists**.

`glob | head -1` is not a lookup — it is a silent tie-break, and the tie is attacker-chosen when
filenames carry a sortable prefix. Cross-checking a field *inside* the file (`id:`) does not
help: whoever plants the decoy writes that field too. Only the count is trustworthy.

The matching test obligation: a fail-safe relaxation must be pinned by tests that assert the
**unsafe inputs are refused** (decoy present, wrong stage type, file missing). A test of the
granted direction alone leaves the relaxation free to regress silently.

## Token-Based Shell Command Classification

For a hook that must decide "does this Bash command run a project-wide build/test?", raw
substring matching is wrong (it blocks `rg "cargo test" doc/`) and naive word-splitting is
bypassable. The working shape:

1. Strip embedded content (heredoc bodies, `-m` message text) so a *mention* is not a match.
2. Normalise newlines to `;`, then pad separators — `;`, `|`, `(`, `)`, and the pair `&&`.
   Never pad a lone `&`: it would split `2>&1` and reopen a redirection bypass.
3. Split with `set -f` plus array splitting so quotes stay attached to their token.
4. Walk tokens tracking **command position** (line start, or after a separator, or after a
   prefix such as `env`/`time`/`xargs`) and **quote state**; only a runner in command position
   counts.
5. Skip redirection tokens when scanning for a positional argument — otherwise `2>&1` is read
   as a scope-narrowing filter.
6. **Allow unmatched commands.** A false block strands a subagent mid-task with no recourse;
   the gate is a guardrail, not a whitelist.
