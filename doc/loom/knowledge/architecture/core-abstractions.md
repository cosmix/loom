## Core Abstractions

### ExecutionGraph (plan/graph/builder.rs)

DAG of stages with dependency tracking. `get_ready()` returns stages with all deps satisfied (status == Completed AND merged == true). Cycle detection via DFS at build time.

### Stage State Machine (models/stage/)

```text
WaitingForDeps --> Queued --> Executing --> Completed
                     |            |
                     v            +--> Blocked, NeedsHandoff, WaitingForInput,
                  Skipped              MergeConflict, CompletedWithFailures, MergeBlocked,
                                       NeedsHumanReview, NeedsAdjudication
```

13 variants total, including `NeedsAdjudication`. `verified` is only a deserialization alias for
`Completed`, not a separate runtime state. Terminal states: Completed, Skipped. Transitions are
validated in transitions.rs. See [patterns.md -- State Machine Pattern](../patterns.md#state-machine-pattern).

**Documented state-machine bypasses:** Two paths intentionally bypass `try_transition`:

1. **`--force-unsafe`** (`handle_force_unsafe_completion`) — sets `Status::Completed` from any state. Manual recovery only.
2. **Phantom-merge revert** (`reconcile_main_repo_active_merge` and `complete()`'s `RevertAndSpawnResolver` arm) — flips a `Completed + merged=true` stage back to `MergeConflict + merged=false + merge_conflict=true` when an active main-repo merge is attributed to that stage. The bypass is necessary because `Completed` is terminal; `try_transition` would refuse, but this is exactly the case the bypass is designed for. All such mutations are logged at `error` level.

**Transitions FROM `NeedsAdjudication`** (`transitions.rs`) — note it can loop to itself:

- `Queued` — verdict applied, stage re-queued
- `NeedsAdjudication` — evidence loop (another round on the same dispute)
- `NeedsHumanReview` — by design, a **`Reject` verdict**: the adjudicator upheld the criterion and ruled the implementation wrong, while the agent disputed it as impossible. Neither side can move, so this is the one outcome a human is needed for. Also reached when a bound is exhausted: the evidence loop (`MAX_EVIDENCE_ROUNDS`, 5), the per-stage amendment cap (`max_amendments_per_stage`, default 10), or the adjudication respawn budget (`MAX_ADJUDICATION_ATTEMPTS`, 3). An earlier version named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set` here; that gate no longer exists — see conventions.md § Adjudicator Transport Convention

`CompletedWithFailures` also transitions into `NeedsAdjudication` (dispute filed after a failed completion) and into `NeedsHumanReview` (budget escalation).

### StageType Enum (plan/schema/types.rs)

- **Standard** (default) -- Regular implementation stages, require goal-backward verification
- **Knowledge** -- No worktree, commits required (directly to main), auto merged=true, exploration focus
- **IntegrationVerify** -- Second-to-last quality gate combining code review AND functional verification
- **KnowledgeDistill** -- Final stage, runs after integration-verify, curates session memories into permanent knowledge (worktree stage; **sonnet default, `high` reasoning effort** — the one `StageType` arm that does not return opus, see `models/stage/types.rs::default_model`; configurable per stage type via `[models]`, see conventions/model-and-effort-config.md)

Signal generation has 4 stable prefix generators in cache.rs (standard, knowledge, integration-verify, knowledge-distill).

### Session Lifecycle (models/session/)

States: Spawning -> Running -> Completed | Crashed | ContextExhausted | Paused. Tracks PID, terminal window ID, absolute `context_tokens` plus `transcript_path` (not a usage percentage — the `context_limit` field was deleted, so there is no denominator stored per-session; the ceiling is resolved per stage, see architecture.md "Context Budget Enforcement"), timestamps.

### SessionBackend (orchestrator/terminal/)

`SessionBackend` is the shared dispatcher for every spawn, kill, and liveness operation. It selects
the native host-terminal lane or the opt-in tmux lane per spawn and persists the lane on
`Session.backend`. Later kill and liveness calls dispatch by that recorded value, so configuration
changes and daemon restarts cannot route an existing session through the wrong backend.

`LivenessService` wraps the same shared `Arc<SessionBackend>`. Process checks use verified PID plus
start-time identity; a missing or mismatched identity fails closed instead of falling back to raw
`kill -0` signaling.

## Data Flow

### Plan Execution Flow

```text
1. loom init doc/plans/PLAN-foo.md
   --> Parse plan, create .work/, write stage files

2. loom run
   --> Spawn daemon (or foreground) --> orchestrator loop

3. Orchestrator loop (5s poll):
   Load stage files --> Build ExecutionGraph --> Find ready stages
   --> Create worktree + signal --> Spawn session --> Monitor via LivenessService

4. Agent reads signal, executes, runs: loom stage complete <id>

5. Progressive merge into main branch (dependency order)
```

### IPC Protocol (`daemon/protocol.rs`, `daemon/wire.rs`)

Unix socket at `.work/orchestrator.sock`. A fixed capability-and-credential preface is authenticated
before the length-prefixed JSON body is allocated. Requests are capped at 64 KiB, responses at
2 MiB, and absolute read deadlines plus bounded workers, queue slots, subscriber counts, and
in-flight bytes prevent slow or oversized clients from exhausting the daemon. User requests cover
status/log subscriptions, Ping, Unsubscribe, and DisputeCriteria; Stop requires a one-time operator
proof.

## File Ownership

| Directory             | Owner Module                     | Purpose              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `.work/stages/`       | orchestrator/core/persistence.rs | Stage state          |
| `.work/sessions/`     | orchestrator/core/persistence.rs | Session state        |
| `.work/signals/`      | orchestrator/signals/            | Agent assignments    |
| `.work/handoffs/`     | orchestrator/continuation/       | Context dumps        |
| `.work/config.toml`   | commands/init/, commands/run/    | Plan reference       |
| `.worktrees/`         | git/worktree/                    | Isolated workspaces  |
| `doc/loom/knowledge/` | fs/knowledge.rs                  | Persistent learnings |

## Layering Violations (Known Issues)

Correct dependency direction: commands/ -> orchestrator/ -> models/ (top), daemon/ / git/ / plan/ (middle), fs/ (bottom).

Known violations (all four are pre-existing, none introduced by the context work):

- daemon imports commands (mark_plan_done_if_all_merged) -- fix: move to fs/plan_lifecycle.rs
- orchestrator imports commands (check_merge_state) -- fix: move to git/merge/status.rs
- git/worktree imports orchestrator (hook config) -- fix: extract loom-hooks/ as top-level
- models imports plan/schema (WiringCheck, StageType) -- fix: move types to models/

### The newer modules are clean (verified 2026-08-17)

The list above predates `context/`, `telemetry/` and `process/`, so its silence about them was
ambiguous rather than reassuring. Verified with
`rg '^use crate::[a-z_]+' loom/src/context`:

- **`context`** imports only `crate::context`, `crate::fs`, `crate::language`, `crate::models`
  and `crate::git`. **No upward edge** to `orchestrator`, `commands` or `daemon`. The single
  `git` edge is deliberate — `git::runner::run_git_checked` at
  `context/refresh/source_graph.rs:30`, needed to list tracked files and judge tree
  cleanliness — and it points downward, so it is not a violation. Record it rather than
  rediscovering it.
- **`telemetry`** is a leaf: one module, no `crate::` imports beyond its own serde types. The
  orchestrator calls into it (`orchestrator/core/stage_telemetry.rs`), never the reverse.
- **`process`** holds the env allowlist and is consumed by both `verify` and the terminal
  spawner without importing either.

The rule to preserve: the orchestrator calls into `context`, never the other way around. A
`use crate::orchestrator` appearing anywhere under `loom/src/context/` is a regression, and the
one-line check above is the way to catch it.

(Note that a match for `crate::external` under `context/extract/rust.rs:132` is inside a golden
test fixture string, not a real import.)
