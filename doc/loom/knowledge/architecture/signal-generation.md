# Signal Generation

> Signal assembly: cache, append helpers, prefixes

## Signal Generation Pipeline (orchestrator/signals/) [DETAILED]

The signal system assembles agent prompt files in a **4-section Manus KV-cache pattern** for token efficiency.

### Call Hierarchy

```text
generate_signal_with_skills() [generate.rs]
  └─ build_signal_context()           # assembles EmbeddedContext
       └─ build_embedded_context_with_stage_and_session()
            ├─ reads handoff (V1 prose / V2 structured)
            ├─ read_plan_overview()
            ├─ KnowledgeDir::has_content()
            └─ format_memory_for_signal(last 10 entries only)
  └─ format_signal_content() [format/mod.rs]
       └─ format_signal_with_metrics()
            ├─ select stable prefix from cache.rs (by stage type)
            ├─ format_semi_stable_section() [sections.rs:15]
            ├─ format_dynamic_section() [sections.rs:382]
            ├─ format_recitation_section() [sections.rs:665]
            └─ SignalMetrics::from_sections() → SHA-256 hash first 16 hex chars
```

Knowledge stages use a SEPARATE path: `generate_knowledge_signal()` [knowledge.rs:23].

### Four Stable-Prefix Generators (cache.rs)

All generators are composed from shared `append_*` helpers and produce immutable KV-cached text.

| Generator          | Function                                      | Line | Stage Type                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------ |
| Standard           | `generate_stable_prefix()`                    | 225  | `StageType::Standard`          |
| Integration-Verify | `generate_integration_verify_stable_prefix()` | 360  | `StageType::IntegrationVerify` |
| Knowledge-Distill  | `generate_knowledge_distill_stable_prefix()`  | 510  | `StageType::KnowledgeDistill`  |
| Knowledge          | `generate_knowledge_stable_prefix()`          | 658  | `StageType::Knowledge`         |

**Standard prefix section order (approx lines 225-355):**

1. Worktree Context header
2. Isolation Boundaries (3 bullets)
3. `append_path_boundaries()` — ALLOWED/FORBIDDEN paths table
4. working_dir reminder
5. Execution Rules header
6. Worktree Isolation detail
7. Delegation & Efficiency paragraph — DELETED (doctrine-surfaces stage), including its codex-lane forward-reference; the stable prefix points at `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` Rule 6 instead of restating delegation guidance inline
8. `append_subagent_restrictions()` — NO commit/complete/add-A rules
9. When to Commit block (`append_commit_timing_rules()`, `signals/helpers.rs`) — commits are the ORCHESTRATOR's, ONLY at the end, after every subagent has returned and the gate is green
10. `append_completion_rules()`
11. `append_adversarial_review()` — Mini Adversarial Code Review (6 dimensions)
12. Dedicated Silent Failure Check block (Standard only; IV has its own section)
13. Stage Memory guidance
14. `append_git_staging_full()`/`append_git_staging_rules()` — DELETED (doctrine-surfaces stage); git-staging rules are stripped to a CLAUDE.md pointer, not emitted inline, on every stage type
15. `append_common_footer()`

**Integration-Verify key differences:** ZERO TOLERANCE box at top; no full git-staging box; now requires agent teams (MUST).

**Knowledge-Distill:** Mission = curate memories → knowledge; includes documentation update reminder.

**Knowledge prefix key differences:** No worktree; COMMITS REQUIRED; "Your Mission = build briefing document"; 6-step workflow; agent teams for bootstrap.

### Shared append_* Helpers

The full table lives in the `## Shared append_* Helpers (cache.rs:51-~180)` section below — an abridged copy that predated `append_anti_slop_guidance()` and `append_adversarial_review()` was deleted from this spot on 2026-07-30. Consult the one table; do not re-inline a second.

**Adding a new helper:** Follow same `fn append_xxx(content: &mut String)` pattern. Call it explicitly from each generator where wanted — it's NOT auto-injected. Placement: cache.rs's "Shared content blocks" cluster is the historical home, but cache.rs carries a maintainability-ledger FILE entry, so new helpers (and any that need to grow) go to the unledgered `signals/helpers.rs` instead — `append_completion_rules`/`append_settled_completion_rules` moved there 2026-08-14. Same rule in format/: the recitation section's budget-exceeded box lives in `format/helpers.rs::append_budget_exceeded_box` because `sections.rs` is ledgered.

**Per-stage code review:** The mandatory mini adversarial code review lives in `append_adversarial_review()` (`pub(crate)`) and is injected into the two code-producing stable prefixes (Standard, IntegrationVerify). It supersedes the older standard-prefix "Self-Review Before Completion" block. Documentation stages (Knowledge, KnowledgeDistill) deliberately omit it — they produce only markdown, so there is no code to review; the cache tests negative-assert its absence there.

**Stable prefix selection — single source of truth:** `cache::stable_prefix_for(stage_type)` is the ONE place that maps stage type → prefix generator (explicit 4-arm match). Both the regular path (`format/mod.rs::format_signal_with_metrics`) and the recovery path (`recovery_format.rs`) call it, so they can never drift.

**Resume-path coverage (important):** The review (and all execution guidance) must reach a stage no matter which signal spawns it. Three paths: (1) regular spawn + automatic crash retry → `format_signal_with_metrics()` → `stable_prefix_for()`; (2) continuation/handoff → `generate_signal()` → same path; (3) **manual recovery** (`loom stage recover`, `loom stage retry`) → `recovery_format.rs::format_recovery_signal()`. The recovery signal is built outside the KV-cache path; it now embeds the FULL stable prefix via `stable_prefix_for(stage.stage_type)` (replacing its old hand-rolled "## Worktree Context" stub), so a resumed stage gets the same rules — review, subagent restrictions, git-staging, anti-slop, completion — as a fresh spawn, correctly gated by stage type (Knowledge/KnowledgeDistill prefixes carry no review). Tests: `recovery.rs::test_generate_recovery_signal` (Standard → review + subagent restrictions + execution rules present) and `test_recovery_signal_omits_review_for_documentation_stage` (KnowledgeDistill → no review). `tests_commit_timing.rs` covers the commit-timing doctrine itself: presence/wording across all 4 stable prefixes, the code-vs-documentation gate condition, `CLAUDE.md.template` agreement, the retired header-bullet wording being gone, the recitation's stage-end-sequence ordering, and the sandbox section's package-cache note.

## Soft Signals

The JSONL-backed `possibly_stuck` soft-signal system this section used to describe is gone. `orchestrator/monitor/soft_signals.rs` no longer exists, and `orchestrator/monitor/tool_analysis.rs` no longer exists either, along with `.loom/work/monitor/soft-signals.jsonl` and `Stage.is_possibly_stuck` — none of those symbols or files exist anymore (verified with a full-tree `rg`, corrected
2026-09-10). Hung-session detection is now entirely heartbeat-driven:

**Detection pipeline (`orchestrator/monitor/heartbeat.rs`, `orchestrator/monitor/hung_latch.rs`):**

1. `HeartbeatWatcher::check_session_hung(stage_id, session_id, timeout)` compares the session's
   last heartbeat against its resolved response budget (`Stage::effective_subagent_timeout_secs()`,
   falling back to `MonitorConfig.hung_timeout`, default 300s / `DEFAULT_HUNG_TIMEOUT_SECS`).
2. `hung_latch::is_stall_escalation` reports a silence twice, never more: once when the budget is
   first crossed (`SessionHung` event, advisory), and once more only if the silence reaches
   `STALL_ESCALATION_MULTIPLIER` (3x) the budget — the escalation line the recovery path acts on.
   A session that answers again clears both latches (`clear_hung_report`), so a blip cannot creep
   toward escalation across unrelated silences.
3. Adjudication sessions (judges) are measured and latched separately
   (`adjudicator_stall_event` → `MonitorEvent::AdjudicatorStalled`), since a stalled judge has no
   stage to hand off — it is closed and the stage it left in `NeedsAdjudication` is re-judged on
   the next poll under the dispute's own attempt budget, latched once rather than twice.
4. A `subagent_timeout_secs: 0` stage never escalates (warnings only), so a mis-configured zero
   budget cannot get a session killed on its first poll.

## Telemetry (`loom/src/telemetry/`)

One append-only JSON-lines file, `.loom/work/telemetry/events.jsonl`, recording five best-effort event
kinds (`TelemetryEvent`, `telemetry/mod.rs`): `ContextDelivered`/`ContextUnavailable` for a spawned
session's context brief, `PromptBrief`/`PromptAbstained` for the `UserPromptSubmit` hook's per-turn
brief (see [Context Retrieval](context-retrieval-state.md#brief-delivery-sanitization-and-telemetry)), and
`ContextPulled` for a `loom knowledge context` retrieval. `emit` may never fail a spawn and
`read_events` skips a malformed line rather than failing the file; every count is an item count,
never a token saving.

`emit` first checks the process's relay mode (`crate::relay::emit::mode`, since `dbec517c`). In
`RelayMode::Relay` it never touches `.loom` at all: `relay_telemetry` writes a relay ticket through
`RelayContext::emit_quiet`, and a relay `check` refusal or a serialization error is silently
swallowed (still best-effort). In Legacy/Operator mode the earlier behavior applies: a sandboxed
session cannot write through the worktree's state-root symlink, so a denied direct write falls back
to a per-worktree spool (`telemetry/spool.rs`, `.loom/telemetry-spool.jsonl`) that the daemon later
drains into the canonical event file.

`ContextDelivered`/`ContextUnavailable` are written by `orchestrator/core/stage_telemetry.rs`
(called from `stage_executor.rs:570`), deriving their fields from the `DeliveryRecord` signal
generation already wrote — no second retrieval. `loom knowledge telemetry`
(`commands/knowledge/telemetry.rs`) is `read_events`'s production caller: it summarizes every event
kind per stage (briefs, prompt briefs emitted/abstained with the top abstain reason, pulls with
average budget/items and unmet-required count, last event time).

## Signal Sections: Semi-Stable, Dynamic, Recitation and EmbeddedContext

### Semi-Stable Section (format/sections.rs:15-378)

Changes per **stage type**, not per session. Key sub-sections:

- **Knowledge reference box** (lines 22-32): the Knowledge Brief footer emits `loom knowledge context --stage <id> --query "<question>" --budget-tokens <n>` (`format/brief.rs::format_knowledge_brief`) when knowledge exists
- **Stage-type-aware reminder box** (lines 35-140): Knowledge/IV/KnowledgeDistill → "KNOWLEDGE UPDATES REQUIRED"; Standard → "SESSION MEMORY REQUIRED"
- **Knowledge management section** (lines 142-290): If knowledge empty → 4-step exploration order; if present → "Extend as you work"
- ~~**Delegation Choices**~~ — REMOVED (doctrine-surfaces stage; it duplicated CLAUDE.md Rule 6). The semi-stable section carries no delegation guidance of its own any more; the signal points at `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` instead
- **Ultracode License** (lines 388-413): Gated on `embedded_context.ultracode`; now also states the Claude-only Workflow-fan-out rule — the codex lane (`gpt-5.6-terra`/`gpt-6-luna`) is not addressable from a Workflow script, so on a stage licensed for both, codex-tier work goes through normal `loom-codex-forwarder` Agent spawns outside the Workflow
- **Sandbox Restrictions** (lines 417-419): Sandbox summary if present, rendered by `format_sandbox_section()` in `format/sandbox_section.rs` (moved out of `sections.rs` 2026-08-26 — `sections.rs` carries a maintainability-ledger FILE entry). When the sandbox is enabled, it always carries `append_package_cache_note()` — the package-manager-cache carve-out note — after the filesystem deny/allow-write block and before the network section
- **Skill Recommendations** (lines 421-426): Skill index matches

### Dynamic Section (format/sections.rs:382-661)

Per-session content. Includes Target (session/stage/plan IDs, working_dir, execution path), Plan Overview, Assignment, Dependency Status + Outputs, Handoff Content, Acceptance Criteria, Goal-Backward Verification (artifacts, wiring, wiring_tests, dead_code).

### Recitation Section (format/sections.rs:665-765)

End of signal for maximum attention. Includes: a single `Context: {tokens} of {ceiling} tokens` line (absolute resident tokens against the resolved ceiling — replaces the old `Compaction Imminent warning (>=75% usage)` / `Context Budget Warning` pair, both deleted with `append_budget_exceeded_box`, their last caller), Immediate Tasks, Stage end sequence line (`append_stage_end_sequence()`, `format/helpers.rs` — recited right after the task list, before the trailing blank line), Stage Memory (with PROMINENT WARNING if empty).

### EmbeddedContext Struct (types.rs:25-61)

Single container flowing through all 4 sections. The struct is currently `types.rs:24-73`.

```rust
pub struct EmbeddedContext {
    pub handoff_content: Option<String>,      // V1 prose handoff
    pub parsed_handoff: Option<HandoffV2>,    // V2 structured handoff
    pub plan_overview: Option<String>,
    pub context_pack: Option<ContextPack>,    // types.rs:35 - this stage's retrieved brief, when retrieval selected anything
    pub knowledge_tree_empty: bool,           // types.rs:45 - doc/loom/knowledge/ has no real content; distinct from context_pack (see doc comment at the field)
    pub memory_content: Option<String>,       // Last 10 entries
    pub skill_recommendations: Vec<SkillMatch>,
    pub context_ceiling_tokens: Option<u32>,  // types.rs:51 - absolute resident-token ceiling, not a percentage
    pub context_tokens: Option<u32>,          // types.rs:53 - absolute resident tokens read from the heartbeat
    pub sandbox_summary: Option<SandboxSummary>,
    pub cross_stage_summary: Option<String>,  // IV/KnowledgeDistill only
    pub wiring_checklist: Option<String>,     // IV/KnowledgeDistill only
    pub ultracode: bool,
    pub implementers: Implementers,           // Licensed lanes, in preference order
    pub codex_available: bool,                // codex CLI + plugin installed; resolved once at build time
    pub subagent_timeout_secs: Option<u64>,   // Per-stage override; None emits nothing
}
```

`context_budget: Option<f32>` and `context_usage: Option<f32>` were renamed to the two absolute-token fields above as part of the context-ceiling migration (see architecture.md "Context Budget Enforcement").

### Caching

SHA-256 of stable prefix text → first 16 hex chars → `SignalMetrics::stable_prefix_hash`. Cache invalidated whenever the stable prefix Rust code changes. Semi-stable, dynamic, recitation sections are always regenerated.
