# Memory Spool and Drain

> Topic notes for the architecture knowledge area.

## The Problem It Solves

`loom memory note` writes `.work/memory/<stage>.md` directly
(`commands/memory/handlers/record.rs`). Inside a worktree stage that write is
**impossible**, and the reasons compound:

- `.work` in a worktree is a **symlink** to the main repo's `.work`, so the
  target is outside the worktree's write boundary.
- The generated stage sandbox grants `Read(.work/memory/**)` but **no matching
  `Edit`** (`sandbox/settings.rs`). Only `.work/handoffs/**` gets a write grant
  — the "EROFS exemption".
- The loom binary is **not exempt from the sandbox**. `excluded_commands` is
  rejected outright by `sandbox/settings/policy.rs::validate_emittable`.

Result: `Read-only file system (os error 30)`. The kernel refuses; loom never
gets a say. See the mistakes entry for the full diagnosis.

## Why Not Just Widen the Allowlist

The sandbox filter is **path-based, not binary-based** — there is no knob that
says "let the loom executable write here". The two available levers both
overshoot:

- Adding `.work/memory` to `allowWrite` grants it to **every** process in the
  session, including the agent's own `Write`/`Edit` tools.
- `excludedCommands` does not grant a path; it runs the command **entirely
  outside** the sandbox. And `loom` is not a leaf command — `loom stage complete`
  executes the stage's acceptance criteria as shell (`verify/criteria/`), so
  exempting the binary exempts arbitrary shell reachable through it.

This matters because memory is not a private scratchpad: `orchestrator/signals/
generate.rs` reads `.work/memory/<dep-id>.md` for each dependency and embeds it
into **downstream stages' prompts**. A memory directory writable by any process
in a stage session is a prompt-injection channel between stages.

## The Design

```text
sandboxed agent      loom memory note "..."
                     ├─ try direct write to .work/memory/<stage>.md
                     └─ on PermissionDenied/EROFS only:
                        append to <worktree>/.loom/memory-spool.jsonl

daemon (outside the sandbox)
  every tick         drain every stage's spool -> .work/memory/<stage>.md
  at teardown        final drain in cleanup_after_merge, before removal
```

**Attribution is by filesystem location.** The spool payload carries **no stage
id** — the daemon attributes each entry to the stage that owns the worktree it
drained from. An agent cannot forge which worktree it is running in, but could
trivially forge a field.

Key modules: `fs/memory/spool.rs` (primitives plus the shared
`drain_into_journal`), `orchestrator/core/spool_drain.rs` (per-tick drain),
`git/cleanup/batch.rs` (teardown drain).

## Invariants That Are Easy To Break

**No status filter on the drain.** `loom stage complete` is a session's *last*
act, so entries recorded just before it are still pending when the stage leaves
`Executing`. Filtering by status strands exactly the most valuable notes — the
end-of-stage lessons. The trigger is spool-file existence; enumerating
`.work/stages/*.md` still validates that the id maps to a real stage.

**The drain returns `()`, not `Result`.** Every other step in the tick loop
propagates with `?`, and an `Err` out of the loop body exits `run()`, which in
the daemon sets the shutdown flag and **kills the daemon**
(`daemon/server/orchestrator.rs`). A spool problem must never do that.

**A validation failure must skip, not error.** `drain_spool` truncates only when
every sink call returns `Ok`. An entry that fails `validate_content` therefore
has to be *skipped* with `Ok(())`; returning `Err` would make one poison entry
redeliver forever and block every good entry behind it. Genuine I/O errors still
return `Err`, because retrying those next tick is correct.

**Teardown drains at `cleanup_after_merge`, not at its callers.** Five paths tear
down worktrees and three have no orchestrator in scope (`loom stage merge`,
`loom cleanup`, `loom stage retry`/`skip`). They all funnel through
`cleanup_after_merge`, so one call covers them. It is best-effort: a spool
failure must never wedge a merge.

**Locking is exclusive, not `O_APPEND`.** Content and context are each capped at
2000 chars, so one entry can exceed the platform's atomic-append window (~4096
bytes) and concurrent subagents would interleave bytes on a line.

**Reads merge the spool.** `loom memory list` is step one of post-compaction
recovery (CLAUDE.md Rule 3b), so `query`/`list`/`show` merge undrained entries,
and the aggregate `list`/`show` additionally surface a stage whose only entries
are still pending — both enumerate journal *files*, which such a stage does not
yet have. Daemon-side readers stay on the pure `read_journal`; they run after
the drain.

## Related

- Stage may only record to its own journal: `record()` rejects a `--stage` that
  disagrees with `LOOM_STAGE_ID` on **both** write paths. `validate_stage_id`
  blocks path separators but not a sibling stage's id.
- The completion broker solves the same "sandboxed agent needs privileged state
  written" problem a different way — hook outside the sandbox plus an
  authenticated RPC. See [mistakes/completion-broker-credential.md](../mistakes/completion-broker-credential.md).
