# Merge Flow

> How a completed stage reaches its target branch

## Merge Flow

How a completed worktree stage reaches the target branch, in the order the daemon runs it, and
what every outcome leaves on disk. Knowledge stages are outside this flow: they commit to the
base directly and `complete_knowledge_stage` sets `merged: true` with no branch.

### The stage is `Completed` before any merge runs

`loom stage complete` inside a worktree verifies only. The PostToolUse broker forwards
`CompleteStage` to the daemon, whose `handle_complete_stage` (`daemon/server/control_complete.rs`)
calls `stage.try_complete(None)` and writes the stage file: `status: completed`, `merged: false`,
`completed_commit: null`. No merge has happened yet, so every merge attempt that follows sees a
stage that is already `Completed`, a terminal state the transition table refuses to leave.

### Where the first merge attempt actually happens

The main loop (`orchestrator/core/orchestrator.rs`) runs `sync_graph_with_stage_files`
(`orchestrator/core/recovery.rs`) before `monitor.poll()` on every tick. The sync finds the fresh
stage, derives `completed_commit` from the `loom/<id>` branch head, runs the ancestry check (false,
nothing is merged yet), marks the graph node Completed, and queues the stage for the "Fix 11"
one-shot retry at the end of the same function. That retry calls `try_auto_merge`
(`orchestrator/core/merge_handler.rs`), which is the first and normal merge attempt. The
`StageCompleted` monitor event, handled next in the same tick by `handle_stage_completed`
(`orchestrator/core/completion_handler.rs`), calls `try_auto_merge` a second time; by then
`merged` is true and the call only runs `cleanup_already_merged`.

`try_auto_merge` in order: auto-merge enabled check (stage, then plan, then daemon default),
phantom guard (`commits_ahead_of` must be > 0), record `completed_commit` from the branch head,
`MergeLifecycle::reconcile_overlay`, then `attempt_auto_merge` (`orchestrator/auto_merge.rs`), which calls
`merge_stage` (`git/merge/mod.rs`): take `MergeLock`, refuse if `MERGE_HEAD` exists, `git checkout
<target>` in the main checkout, `git merge --no-ff -m "Merge loom/<id> into <target>"`.

### Outcomes

| Outcome | Stage file afterwards | Daemon |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Merge succeeded and `verify_merge_succeeded` proves ancestry | `Completed`, `merged: true`; `finish_verified_merge` reconciles the base and removes worktree and branch | continues |
| Conflicts | forced to `MergeConflict`, resolver session spawned | stays alive for the resolver |
| `git merge` or checkout failed (dirty main checkout, lock timeout, missing branch) | forced to `MergeBlocked`, `failure_info` type `InfrastructureError` with the git error as evidence | last stage: exits; `loom status` shows MERGE ERROR |
| Merge ran but ancestry cannot be verified | forced to `MergeBlocked`, reason in `failure_info` | same |
| Branch has zero commits beyond target | forced to `NeedsHumanReview`, `review_reason` says the agent never committed | exits; NEEDS REVIEW |
| Auto-merge disabled for the stage or plan | stays `Completed + !merged` by design | exits; `loom status` shows unmerged |

`persist_merge_blocked` is the single writer for the blocked outcomes and `route_to_human_review`
for the review outcome; both use `force_status_with_reason` because `Completed` has no legal exits.
Nothing on the daemon path ever writes `merged: true` without `is_ancestor_of` returning true.

### Recovery from every non-merged outcome

`loom stage merge <id>`, run from the stage worktree, accepts `MergeConflict`, `MergeBlocked`, and
`Completed + !merged` (`commands/stage/merge/preflight.rs::require_merge_state`). It re-runs
`merge_stage` and, on success, `try_complete_merge`, which tolerates an already-Completed stage.
Until 2026-09-06 the command refused `Completed` stages while the daemon log and the status UI
both pointed at it, which is why operators fell back to `git merge loom/<id>` by hand.

The merge runs in the operator's main checkout. `git merge` refuses when it would overwrite
tracked modifications or untracked files, and it ALSO refuses whenever anything is staged in that
checkout's index, even on paths the merge never touches. The error lists the staged paths as
"local changes ... would be overwritten by merge", which reads as an overlap when there is none.
An earlier version of this section named only the overwrite case. On 2026-09-13 a knowledge-distill
merge failed this way because another agent staged a `hooks/` to `loom-hooks/` rename in the main
checkout in the same second the daemon merged.

When agents share the main checkout, do not stash or reset their work. Wait until it is committed,
then merge the target INTO `loom/<id>` inside the stage worktree, resolve conflicts there, rerun
the stage's acceptance, commit, and run `loom stage merge <id>`; the shared checkout never holds a
conflicted merge. `loom stage merge` leaves the worktree and branch in place. `loom worktree remove
<id>` removes them but refuses while the worktree holds ignored files such as `loom/target/` or a
generated `REVIEW-PLAN-*.md` (move the review into the main `doc/plans/` first). From a sandboxed
session git cannot delete `.git/worktrees/<id>` (`Device or resource busy`); run `git worktree
prune` from an operator shell.

## Merge Lock (git/merge/lock.rs)

`MergeLock` serializes loom-driven merges with an exclusive OS advisory lock (`fs2::try_lock_exclusive`) on the stable `.loom/work/merge.lock` inode. The file is created once and never unlinked; the holder's pid and timestamp are written into it for diagnosis only. `acquire` polls every 100 ms up to the caller's timeout (30 s from `merge_stage` and the probe). Release is by `Drop` or process exit, so there is no stale-lock reclamation and a pid left in the file after a merge is not a held lock. An earlier version of this section named `progressive_merge/lock.rs` and a five-minute stale sweep; neither exists.
