# Remote Control

> Capability detection, preflight, resolution, and per-kind session naming for driving external agent binaries.

## Remote Control Module (loom/src/remote_control.rs)

Claude Code's `--remote-control` flag lets the loom orchestrator drive Claude sessions programmatically. It exits non-zero when prerequisites are unmet, so it must be gated by a preflight check before use. `--remote-control [name]` also takes an _optional_ name argument (verified against claude 2.1.226 `--help`) — loom names every spawned session after its stage.

**Key types:**

- `RemoteControlMode` (`auto` | `off`) — operator-facing switch persisted in `.loom/work/config.toml [remote_control]`.
- `RemoteControlConfig` — the persisted config struct (single `mode` field).
- `RemoteControlStatus` (`Enabled` | `Disabled { reason }`) — preflight result.
- `RemoteControlInvocation` (`Disabled` | `Bare` | `Named(String)`) — the concrete per-spawn decision, returned by `resolve_invocation`.

**Key functions:**

| Function                                     | Purpose                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `preflight(claude_path)`                     | Combines version probe + auth-eligibility heuristic                                                                                        |
| `claude_supports_remote_control(path)`       | Version gate only (>= 2.1.51)                                                                                                              |
| `remote_control_eligible()`                  | Auth heuristic: no disqualifying env var + `~/.claude/.credentials.json` present                                                           |
| `resolve(work_dir)`                          | Mode/preflight/in-memory-disable-flag gate — unchanged `bool` contract, now called ONLY by the crash handler's fast-fail check              |
| `resolve_invocation(work_dir, session_name)` | **The real per-spawn gate.** Layers a memoized `--help` capability probe over `resolve()`; returns `Disabled`/`Bare`/`Named(session_name)` |
| `run_startup_preflight(path, work_dir)`      | Advisory startup warning if disabled                                                                                                       |
| `disable_for_this_process(reason)`           | Sets an in-memory, process-lifetime flag so `resolve()` returns false; logs one stderr line; nothing persisted to disk                     |

**`resolve_invocation` resolution model (in order):**

1. `!resolve(work_dir)` (mode off / marker present / preflight fails) → `Disabled`
2. `find_claude_path()` fails → `Disabled` (defensive; `resolve()` already failed closed on this)
3. Memoized `--help` capability probe (`cached_named_arg_supported`, separate `OnceLock` from the version-preflight cache) — does `claude --help` output contain the literal substring `--remote-control [name]`?
   - Yes → `Named(session_name)`
   - No (older claude that accepts the flag but not the optional argument) → `Bare`

**Session naming (`remote_control_session_name`, `orchestrator/terminal/native/launch.rs`):**

Derived in `prepare_session_launch` — the shared funnel both native and tmux backends call — from `stage.name` (falls back to `stage.id` when empty after trim):

| `SessionType`  | Session name                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `Stage`        | `<stage.name>`                |
| `Merge`        | `Merge: <stage.name>`         |
| `BaseConflict` | `Base conflict: <stage.name>` |
| `Knowledge`    | `Knowledge: <stage.name>`     |

**Fallback / fast-fail path (crash_handler.rs):**

If a session crashes within `FAST_FAIL_WINDOW_SECS` (15s) of creation with a verified PID while `resolve()` is true, the crash handler calls `disable_for_this_process(reason)` and classifies the crash as an ORDINARY crash: normal exponential-backoff retry, `--remote-control` omitted on the retry (`resolve()` now returns false for the rest of this process's lifetime, so `resolve_invocation` returns `Disabled`). Nothing is persisted — a daemon restart tries remote control again. Every OTHER fast verified-pid crash is a startup refusal (`is_startup_refusal`, `orchestrator/core/crash_classification.rs`): blocked, not retried. `resolve()` itself was untouched by the session-naming work — only its callers changed (the crash handler still calls it directly; the spawn path goes through `resolve_invocation`).

**Config persistence:**

`fs/work_dir.rs` exposes `read_remote_control_config()` / `write_remote_control_config()` using the `[remote_control]` section of `.loom/work/config.toml`. Pattern mirrors `read_plan_sandbox` / `write_plan_sandbox`.

**Auth disqualifying env vars (Remote Control requires claude.ai login):**

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY`

**Known limitations (2026-08-08):**

- `cached_named_arg_supported` (named-arg support) and `cached_preflight_enabled` (version+auth) each memoize on a `OnceLock<bool>` keyed by nothing, ignoring the `claude_path` argument they accept — consistent with each other, but means a `claude_path` that changes mid-process (unlikely) would not be re-probed. Two/three `which::which` lookups still happen per spawn (`resolve()` → `find_claude_path()`, then `resolve_invocation` calls it again) — accepted as consistent with existing precedent, not fixed.
- The wrapper script also exports `CLAUDE_REMOTE_CONTROL_SESSION_NAME_PREFIX=loom` (`native/pid_tracking.rs`) for auto-generated names; claude's own `--help` documents this prefix as applying only to auto-generated names, not an explicit `--remote-control=<name>`. Corroborated by the `--help` text but NOT confirmed against a live claude.ai Remote Control connection — not smoke-testable in this sandbox (no TTY/login flow for an interactive RC session).
- A stage name beginning with `-` is joined to the flag via `=` (`--remote-control=<name>`), not a space, specifically because `--remote-control` takes an _optional_ argument and a space-separated value starting with `-` risks being reparsed as a separate CLI flag by claude's own parser. `shell_escape` alone does not neutralize this: `-` is in its safe, returned-unquoted-verbatim charset.
- The `Bare` vs `Named` branch of `resolve_invocation` cannot be exercised both ways in one `cargo test` binary (shared process-global `OnceLock`). Verified once via an isolated `cargo test --lib <test> -- --exact --nocapture` run against this machine's real claude install (confirmed the full chain: derived name → `Named` → `--remote-control='Merge: ...'` in the generated wrapper script's `exec` line) rather than as a committed test.

## `loom pressure` Command (Plan Pressure-Testing Driver)

`loom pressure <plan> [--rounds N=2] [--claude-model M] [--codex-model M] [--address-model M] [--dry-run]` (loom/src/commands/pressure/mod.rs) is a standalone, **synchronous foreground** driver that hardens a plan by combining two external agents. It is a second execution model distinct from the daemon/worktree orchestrator: it runs in the user's repo — NOT a worktree, NOT a background daemon, NOT a terminal-spawn.

Per round (default 2): delete the codex report → run **Claude `/pressure` (foreground) and Codex `$pressure` (background) CONCURRENTLY** → once both finish, run Claude `/address <plan>` (folds Codex's written review back into the plan). One final report deletion after all rounds. Because the two pressure-tests run in parallel, Codex reviews the _pre-edit_ plan while Claude edits it — a more independent perspective; `/address` reconciles both afterward.

**TTY constraint:** Claude Code enters its non-interactive `-p` path whenever **stdout is not a TTY** (piped/redirected), even without `-p` (confirmed in `claude --help`). An earlier version of this line said that path bills pay-per-token API credits instead of the claude.ai subscription; per the owner (2026-09-15) `-p` usage is not charged separately. Claude's stdout must still stay the real terminal: `/pressure` and `/address` run in the **foreground** (interactive, visible), and cannot be captured or backgrounded without leaving interactive mode. Codex — which has separate auth and floods stdout with a verbose event stream — is the one backgrounded, with stdout+stderr captured to a temp log (`$TMPDIR/loom-pressure-codex-<pid>.log`); its tail is printed on non-clean exit.

**Auto-exit without `-p` (mirrors the daemon):** interactive Claude never exits on its own after a slash command, and EOF on stdin makes the REPL quit _before_ the work finishes. So the driver replicates how the daemon ends a session (`event_handler.rs` → `NativeBackend::kill_session` → SIGTERM once the stage completes): it injects a completion instruction via `--append-system-prompt` telling the agent to `touch <marker>` as its FINAL action, polls for that marker file, then SIGTERMs (escalating to SIGKILL after a grace period) the now-idle foreground session. If the marker never appears the user can still exit manually (graceful fallback = old behavior). Codex is non-interactive and exits on its own.

Children run with `current_dir(repo_root)` (resolved via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`), so the plan argument handed to them is **repo-relative** (e.g. `doc/plans/PLAN-foo.md`), never cwd-relative. Claude argv: `--permission-mode auto --model <resolved> --append-system-prompt <marker-instruction> <slash>` with `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` and stdin/stdout/stderr inherited. Codex argv: `exec --sandbox workspace-write -m <resolved> -c model_reasoning_effort=xhigh -C <repo_root> <skill>` with stdin `/dev/null` and stdout/stderr → the log file. **All three models are operator-selectable** and resolved per slot by `PressureModels::resolve` (`pressure/models.rs`): CLI flag → `~/.loom/config.toml`'s `pressure.{claude,codex,address}_model` → built-in default (`opus`/`gpt-5.6-sol`/`opus`, the `DEFAULT_PRESSURE_*_MODEL` consts in `claude.rs`/`codex.rs`). The accepted vocabularies are the `CLAUDE_MODELS`/`CODEX_MODELS` slices in those same two modules — one source of truth shared by the clap `PossibleValuesParser`, the user-config registry's `ValueKind::Enum`, and the shell completions. The `/pressure` and `/address` slots are independent, so the two Claude steps can run on different models. Reasoning effort stays pinned (`CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` in pressure/spawn.rs — codex has no dedicated effort flag, hence the `-c` config override). Both the dry-run preview and the real run print the three resolved models in their header. NOTE: Codex has been observed printing a non-fatal `worker transport error / authorization required` warning at startup even while logged in and continuing to work — it is codex-side, not a loom bug; the captured log now keeps it off the terminal. Because codex is otherwise invisible (no output; the spinner shows only when codex outlives Claude; the report is deleted as final cleanup), the driver prints status lines: `→ codex review started in background (log: …)` at spawn, and `✓ codex review written → <report>` (or a warning if codex exited cleanly without writing the report) after it finishes — without these, a codex run that finished before Claude was repeatedly mistaken for never having started.

Supporting pieces:

- `loom/src/codex.rs` — `find_codex_path()` binary resolver, mirrors `claude::find_claude_path` (which::which, then candidate install paths favoring ~/.bun/bin; spawned children may not inherit PATH so resolve eagerly).
- Vendored agent assets (installed LOCALLY by install.sh): `commands/{pressure,address,distill}.md` → `~/.claude/commands/`; `codex/skills/pressure/SKILL.md` → `~/.codex/skills/pressure/`.
- Wiring: `Commands::Pressure(PressureArgs)` — a TUPLE variant in cli/types.rs whose args live in `cli/types_pressure.rs`, because types.rs sits at its 400-line ceiling — dispatched in cli/dispatch.rs; `pressure` registered in dynamic completions with `--rounds`/`--dry-run` plus the three model flags (`--claude-model`/`--address-model` → `complete_model_names`, `--codex-model` → `complete_codex_model_names`).
