# Web Dashboard Typography

> Dashboard chrome type conventions and CSS gotchas for settings/graph views

## Dashboard chrome uses the body face, never all-caps monospace (2026-09-12)

The web dashboard's controls, cues and status words are set in the body face (Inter) at 12-13px, weight 500, sentence case. Monospace is reserved for values that are literally code or identifiers: stage ids, branch names, screen sizes, and the terminal well itself. Uppercase with wide tracking is reserved for the three existing label utilities (`eyebrow`, `.stage-tag`, `.rank-caption`); do not coin new all-caps monospaced chips for buttons or indicators.

Set on 2026-09-12 when the terminal view's mode key, the "take control" cue over the well, the ended/dropped stamp and the `>_` card glyph were reset from 10-11px uppercase mono to this convention (`web/src/components/terminal/terminal-controls.css`, `terminal.css`). The card glyph sits last in the stage card header so it lands in the card's top-right corner, after the hover-only open button (`web/src/components/graph/stage-node.tsx`).

Rebuilding the bundle: `web/dist` is embedded by `loom/build.rs`, so a frontend change ships only once `cd web && bun run build` has run and the rebuilt `web/dist` is committed as its own `chore(web): rebuild the dashboard bundle ...` commit.

## A Read-Only Slot's Text Needs an Explicit Line-Height, Not `inline-flex`, to Centre (2026-09-12)

`.settings-ctl-readonly` is a `<span>` blockified as a flex item of `.settings-slot`
(28px tall); with `line-height: normal` its text hugs the top instead of centring.
Fix with an explicit `line-height: 26px` (the 28px border-box height minus two 1px
borders) on the span itself — not `inline-flex`, which centres the text but disables
`text-overflow: ellipsis` on the phone-card layout. `overflow: hidden` +
`text-overflow: ellipsis` is scoped to `.settings-tc .settings-ctl` (the phone-card
selector) rather than the shared `.settings-ctl` rule, so the table layout's cells
never truncate.

## Where the Dashboard's Theme Tokens Live

`web/src/index.css` defines the `--tone-*` state tones and `--hairline`, and also the accent helpers `--highlight` / `--highlight-foreground` (active view tab), `--logo` (header logo colour) and the ledger ruling `--ledger-rule` / `--ledger-head-rule`. It no longer holds only the tones and `--hairline`. The ruling rules at the end of `index.css` are unlayered on purpose: the table's `border-b` utilities sit in Tailwind's utilities layer, which outranks the components layer.

Surface tokens (`--background`, `--card`, `--foreground`, `--muted`, `--muted-foreground`, `--border`, `--ring`, `--primary`) live in `web/src/aurora-ui/shared/styles/tokens.css`. The bare `:root` block (near line 94) is the Ledger light theme (stone stock, hue ~100, blue-black ink); the first `.dark` block (near line 144) is the Aubergine dark theme (hue 325). The yellow accent is `--primary`. On the light ground yellow is only legible as a fill under dark ink, so the light `--ring` is a darker ochre. `--tone-warning` and `--hazard-warning` are orange so warning states never read as the accent. The atoms in `web/src/aurora-ui/shared/atoms/theme.ts` default to the `ledger` / `aubergine` variant names, which no CSS selects; no UI sets a variant, only the light/dark toggle.

The terminal well is `--well: #0a111f` in `web/src/components/terminal/terminal.css` and must equal `WELL` in `emulator.ts`, since xterm's canvas needs hex; the xterm cursor is the dark `--primary` as hex (`#f4d660`). The terminal view has no Esc-to-release: in control mode Esc reaches the agent, and only the release control stops sending (`web/src/components/terminal/terminal-view.tsx`).
