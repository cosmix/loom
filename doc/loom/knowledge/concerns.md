## Architecture Concerns

### Layering Violations (2026-01-29)

> **Full details:** See [architecture.md § Review Findings - Layering Violations](architecture.md#review-findings---layering-violations-2026-01-29)

Critical violations where lower layers import from higher layers:

- daemon imports commands (mark_plan_done_if_all_merged)
- orchestrator imports commands (check_merge_state)
- git/worktree imports orchestrator (hook config)
- models imports plan/schema (type definitions)

## Security Concerns

### Release Asset Verification Gap

Only binary files are signature-verified via minisign. Non-binary release assets lack verification:

- CLAUDE.md.template
- agents.zip
- skills.zip

**Recommended:** Add SHA256 checksum verification for all release assets.

## Code Quality Concerns

### Code Consolidation Needed

> **Full details:** See [conventions.md § Code Consolidation Opportunities](conventions.md#code-consolidation-opportunities-2026-01-29)

Key duplications needing consolidation:

- parse_stage_from_markdown: 4 copies
- branch_name_for_stage: 22+ inline format!() calls
- extract_yaml_frontmatter: 2 copies
- compute_level: 4 copies in status modules

### Debug Output in Production

`eprintln!` statements with 'Debug:' prefix in production code (complete.rs, orchestrator.rs). Should use tracing crate with log levels.
