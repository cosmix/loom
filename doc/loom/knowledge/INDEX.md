# Knowledge Index

> Read this index first, then only what it points to: the section for your area in a tier-1 summary (`rg -n '^## ' <file>` lists them) and the tier-2 topics your task touches. A specific question is cheaper to pull than to read — `loom knowledge context --query "..."` returns the matching sections quoted.
