# Handoff Template

Location: `.work/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-desc.md`

## Template

```markdown
# Handoff: [Description]

- **Stage**: [stage-id] | **Context**: [X]%

## Completed
[file:line refs for completed work]

## Next Steps
[prioritized tasks with file:line refs]
```

## When to Create

Create a handoff when:
- Context usage reaches 75%
- Session must end before stage completion
- Work needs to continue in a new session

## Guidelines

- Use exact `file:line` references, not descriptions
- Prioritize next steps by importance
- Include any blockers or dependencies discovered
