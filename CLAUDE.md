# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Loom is a self-propelling agent orchestration CLI written in Rust. It coordinates Claude Code sessions across git worktrees, enabling parallel task execution with automatic crash recovery and context handoffs.

This is an unreleased project under active development NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILTY OR MIGRATION ROUTINES SHOULD BE ADDED AT THIS STAGE.

## Build Commands

```bash
cd loom
cargo build                    # Development build
cargo build --release          # Release build
cargo test                     # Run all tests
cargo test stage_transitions   # Run single test file
cargo test --test e2e          # Run end-to-end tests
cargo clippy -- -D warnings    # Lint with warnings as errors
cargo fmt --check              # Check formatting
```

Tests use `serial_test` for isolation - many tests cannot run in parallel.

## Architecture

```

### Key Abstractions

**ExecutionGraph** (`plan/graph/`): DAG of stages with dependency tracking. Determines which stages are ready to execute.

**Stage** (`models/stage/types.rs`): Unit of work with lifecycle:
`WaitingForDeps → Queued → Executing → Completed/Blocked/NeedsHandoff`

**Session** (`models/session/`): Represents a Claude Code process executing a stage. Tracks PID, context usage, timestamps.

**Orchestrator** (`orchestrator/core/orchestrator.rs`): Main loop that polls stage/session state, spawns ready stages, handles crashes.

**TerminalBackend** (`orchestrator/terminal/`): Abstraction for spawning sessions in OS terminal windows.

### State Directory (`.work/`)

All state is file-based for git-friendliness:

- `config.toml` - Active plan reference and settings
- `stages/*.md` - Stage state files (markdown with YAML frontmatter)
- `sessions/*.md` - Session tracking files
- `signals/*.md` - Agent assignment signals
- `handoffs/*.md` - Context dump records
- `orchestrator.sock` - Unix socket for daemon IPC
- `orchestrator.pid` - Daemon process ID

### Daemon Architecture

`loom run` spawns a background daemon that:

1. Listens on Unix socket for status/stop commands
2. Polls stage files every 5 seconds
3. Creates git worktrees for parallel stages
4. Spawns Claude Code in terminal windows
5. Detects crashes via PID liveness checks
6. Generates git-based crash reports

### Plan Format

Plans are markdown files in `doc/plans/` with embedded YAML for use by loom:

````markdown
<!-- loom METADATA -->

```yaml
loom:
  version: 1
  stages:
    - id: stage-id
      name: "Human Name"
      description: "Task details"
      dependencies: ["other-stage"]
      acceptance: ["cargo test"]
      files: ["src/**/*.rs"]
```
````

Look in doc/plans for the plan files!

<!-- END loom METADATA -->

### Plan File Lifecycle

Plan files are automatically renamed to reflect execution status:

| State       | Filename                      | When                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Not started | `PLAN-feature.md`             | Initial plan file          |
| In progress | `IN_PROGRESS-PLAN-feature.md` | After `loom run` starts    |
| Completed   | `DONE-PLAN-feature.md`        | When all stages are merged |

Behavior details:

- `loom run` renames the plan file to add `IN_PROGRESS-` prefix
- When orchestration completes successfully and all stages have `merged: true`, the prefix changes to `DONE-`
- If not all stages are merged, the plan stays as `IN_PROGRESS-` for manual intervention
- Re-running a `DONE-` plan does not rename it (prevents accidental status reset)
- The `source_path` in `.work/config.toml` is automatically updated to track renames

## Remember your Mandatory Rules!

Claude.md rules are mandatory and supersede any Plan Mode or other Claude instructions!

Ignore the test-project, unless the user explicitly asks you to read or work with it to test a loom feature.

Remember: NEVER write plans to ~/.claude/plans. It is strictly forbidden.
