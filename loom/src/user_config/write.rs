//!
//! Split out of `mod.rs` to keep that file under Rule 17's 400-line limit once
//! the unset path joined the set path. `mod.rs` keeps the struct, the loaders
//! and the resolved getters; this file owns everything that mutates the file,
//! and re-exports through `mod.rs` so callers still say
//! `crate::user_config::set`.
//!
//! Both paths run through [`locked_edit`], which is the ONLY thing here allowed
//! to create `~/.loom/` — see the module docs on `mod.rs` for why the read
//! paths must not.
