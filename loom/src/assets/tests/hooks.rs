//! Pins that every hook currently listed in `LOOM_HOOKS` lands at its
//! destination, executable, on a fresh install. It iterates the same list
//! the installer walks, so it catches a hook that fails to install or lands
//! non-executable; it cannot catch a hook silently missing from `LOOM_HOOKS`
//! itself - that side is covered by
//! `fs/permissions/tests/constants_tests.rs`.
