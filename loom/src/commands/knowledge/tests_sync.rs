//! Tests for `commands/knowledge/sync.rs`.

//! `sync`'s CWD-dependent tests (it resolves `.` via `resolve()`/`WorkDir::new`,
//! same as `update`/`replace_section` in `tests.rs`) reuse that module's
//! `setup_test_env`/`make_legacy` helpers rather than duplicating them —
//! `tests_legacy.rs` already sets the precedent for reaching across sibling
//! test modules with `super::tests::...`; this module is one level deeper
