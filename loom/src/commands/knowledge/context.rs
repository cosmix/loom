//! `loom knowledge context` — deterministic, offline context retrieval.
//!
//! Presentation only. The retrieval itself lives in
//! [`crate::context::retrieve::retrieve_for_stage`], which every other consumer
//! of context also calls; this module turns a CLI invocation into a
//! [`StageQuery`] and renders the resulting [`ContextPack`]. There is no model
//! call and no network access anywhere in this path.
