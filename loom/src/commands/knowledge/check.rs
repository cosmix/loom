//! `loom knowledge check` — report knowledge-base diagnostics WITHOUT ever
//! opening the context store, which is what makes it safe to run as a loom
//! stage's acceptance criterion.
//!
//! `loom knowledge sync` resolves through `context::retrieve::resolve_roots`
//! (`commands/knowledge/context.rs:29`), which calls `ContextStore::open`
//! (`context/store.rs:49`). `open` itself only COMPUTES the cache root: it
//! follows `WorkDir::main_project_root` OUT of a worktree, through the
//! state directory symlink, to the MAIN repository, and joins `.loom/cache`. The
//! write happens later, when `sync`'s `refresh` (`context/refresh.rs:218`)
//! calls `ContextStore::save_catalog` (`context/store.rs:108`) against that
//! root — a write that escapes worktree isolation, and both settings
//! emitters strip `.loom` from `allow_write`, so `sync` can never sit in a
//! stage's acceptance list without tripping the sandbox.
//! `catalog::build(root: &Path)` (`fs/knowledge/catalog.rs`) is pure: it reads
//! the tree and returns diagnostics, writing nothing. `check` resolves ONLY
//! the knowledge root — never the context store — and calls `catalog::build`
//! directly. `skills/loom-plan-writer/SKILL.md` already names `loom knowledge
//! check` as knowledge-distill's acceptance criterion, so this command fills a
//! contract that already ships; do not "simplify" it back into
//! `context::resolve()`.
