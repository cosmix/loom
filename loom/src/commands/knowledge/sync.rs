//! `loom knowledge sync` — upgrade a flat knowledge tree, refresh `INDEX.md`,
//! and rebuild derived context artifacts.
//!
//! `sync` is the single, explicit flat-to-hierarchical upgrade: a knowledge
//! directory that predates the tiered layout has no `INDEX.md`, and this is the
//! one command that creates it. Nothing else migrates a flat dir — `update` and
//! every retrieval path leave it flat forever.
//!
//! On an ALREADY-hierarchical directory `sync` still regenerates `INDEX.md`
//! unconditionally, not just on the one-time upgrade. `update` and
//! `replace-section` each refresh it too after their own write
//! (`KnowledgeDir::refresh_index_if_hierarchical`, `fs/knowledge/dir.rs`), but
//! CLAUDE.md Rule 12 also sanctions editing `doc/loom/knowledge/*.md` directly
//! with Edit/Write in an interactive session — a path that writes no index at
//! all. `sync` is the command an agent reaches for to fix that up, so it must
//! not be a no-op on a healthy tree; see [`sync`]'s own doc for why the write
//! failure there is best-effort.
//!
//! Everything after that is derived state: `refresh` rebuilds the catalog when
//! stale and persists it to the cache, and is a no-op when the catalog is
//! already current.
