//! `loom hook pre-compact` — reopen delivery suppression for a compacting session.
//!
//! `loom-hooks/pre-compact.sh` already runs a block-then-allow handoff protocol on
//! every PreCompact event (see that script's own header); this delegate rides
//! alongside it, deleting exactly one delivery record so retrieval stops
//! assuming the compacting session still holds what it was already given.
//!
//! Suppression in [`crate::context::delivery`] is scoped to a recipient and an
//! epoch: while a session's context window is intact, skipping units it
//! already read is correct. A compaction breaks that assumption — the
//! summarized context that survives compaction may drop the brief entirely —
//! so the moment compaction happens is the moment this session's own record
//! must stop suppressing anything. It is NOT a moment to touch any *other*
//! record: a live sibling session's suppression, and the stage's own spawn
//! record, both describe context windows this compaction never touched.
//!
//! Same fail-open contract as every hook delegate in this module (see
//! `super::user_prompt`): malformed or absent stdin, an environment naming
//! neither a stage nor a checkout, or a filesystem error all read as "nothing
//! to reset" rather than a failure. A PreCompact hook that errors or prints
//! disrupts compaction, and a delivery record is an optimisation nothing here
//! may treat as load-bearing (`crate::context::delivery`'s own module doc).
