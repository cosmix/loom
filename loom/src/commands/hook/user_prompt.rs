//! `loom hook user-prompt` — the deterministic UserPromptSubmit entry point.
//!
//! Reads the hook payload from stdin, retrieves a small pack for the prompt,
//! and prints one JSON object carrying the units THIS SESSION has not already
//! been handed in this epoch. There is **no model call and no network call**
//! anywhere below this function: retrieval is pure filesystem and string work.
//!
//! A loom stage is not a precondition. Inside one the brief is keyed to the
//! stage; outside one it is keyed to the checkout's working-tree overlay — the
//! same `(plan, stage)` address `loom map` and `loom knowledge sync` write — so
//! an ordinary session in a mapped repository gets the same retrieval a stage
//! does.
//!
//! Three gates stand between a prompt and a printed brief, in order:
//! `parse_prompt` drops machine-generated payloads before retrieval even
//! runs (task-notification XML, stopped-agent notices — see
//! `is_machine_generated`) and strips the `@` file attachments whose paths
//! would otherwise steer retrieval (`user_prompt_attachments.rs`);
//! `user_prompt_compose.rs`'s admission floor drops retrieval items too weak
//! to be worth saying anything about; and `HookTarget::already_delivered` drops
//! whatever THIS session — not some other session that happens to share the
//! stage — has already been handed this epoch.
//!
//! Every failure is an empty stdout and exit 0. A prompt-submit hook that
//! reports a problem is a prompt-submit hook that interrupts the session, so
//! the only two outcomes here are "one useful object" and "nothing at all".
//!
//! Split across two files to stay under the maintainability line limit: this
//! one owns recipient resolution, the hook's own filters, and the
//! print/record/reconcile ordering; `user_prompt_compose.rs` owns turning a
//! pack into the one stdout line.
