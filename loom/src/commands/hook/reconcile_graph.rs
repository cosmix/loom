//! `loom hook reconcile-graph` — the A.12/A.22 debounced background self-heal.
//!
//! The prompt hook's own latency budget (a few seconds, well inside the shell
//! wrapper's 5s ceiling) must never pay for rebuilding a source graph, but a
//! stale or [`ContextPack::degraded`] pack (A.11) still deserves fixing —
//! just not on the request that noticed it. [`spawn_if_needed`] launches this
//! module's own subcommand, [`reconcile_graph`], detached and unawaited, so
//! the *next* retrieval benefits instead. See
//! `doc/PROPOSAL-retrieval-precision.md` §A.12/§A.22 and §P3 recommendation
//! 12 for the design.
//!
//! ## Debounce
//!
//! See the `lock` submodule for the `reconcile.lock` file's encoding and the
//! full Spawn/Skip policy table. In short: `try_reconcile` never unlinks
//! the lock, it REWRITES it — once at the very start, correcting the pid
//! field from whatever [`spawn_if_needed`] claimed it with to this process's
//! own pid, and once at the very end to a finished marker, on BOTH outcomes.
//! See `try_reconcile`'s own comments for why each rewrite is necessary.
//!
//! ## Scope resolution
//!
//! `ReconcileTarget::from_environment` mirrors
//! `commands::hook::user_prompt::DeliveryTarget::from_environment` point for
//! point (stage scope when `LOOM_STAGE_ID`/`LOOM_WORK_DIR` name a real stage,
//! else the checkout's own working-tree overlay) but is a second, small
//! implementation rather than a shared one: `DeliveryTarget` is private to
//! that sibling file, which this module does not own.
//!
//! Checkout scope calls
//! `crate::context::refresh::reconcile_semantic_best_effort` — promoted
//! from `pub(super)` to `pub(crate)` in `context::refresh::semantic` for
//! exactly this call site — rather than re-implementing its Base-then-overlay
//! fallback (publish an immutable base for a clean HEAD, fall back to the
//! `_local` working-tree overlay when that is refused). One derivation of
//! that policy, not two: see the promoted function's own doc comment.
