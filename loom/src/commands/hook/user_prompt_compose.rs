/// Only ONE item needs to clear the bar: an exact-rung [`SelectionReason`]
/// (see [`is_exact_rung`] — these are post-gating reasons now, so a hit on one
/// of them means something a bare lexical score does not), or a lexical match
/// on at least `config.min_knowledge_terms` distinct query terms —
/// `matched_term_count` is exactly that per-item strength signal, carried on
/// the item for this reason.
///
/// The term-count clause applies to ANY item, not just a `KnowledgeChunk` —
/// deliberately, not as a loosening. `matched_term_count` counts DISTINCT
/// SURVIVING query terms: corpus-ubiquitous terms are already gone, stripped
/// by the stopwording pass in `context/rank/corpus/stopwords.rs`, so two
/// surviving terms is genuine evidence whichever channel produced it. If
/// anything the bar is HARDER for a source node than a knowledge chunk: its
/// BM25 document is only its scope segments plus a one-line signature
/// (`rank_source.rs::node_document`), a far smaller surface than a prose
/// chunk's whole body, so matching two distinct surviving terms there is a
/// stronger signal than the same count against a knowledge chunk.
///
/// A knowledge-only clause would silently blackout a real configuration: a
/// checkout with a mapped source graph (`loom map`) but no curated knowledge
/// tree has no `KnowledgeChunk` items at all, so a knowledge-only second
/// clause could never fire — every prompt that does not spell an identifier
/// in identifier form (most of them; see the identifier-shaped-evidence
/// gating behind [`is_exact_rung`]) would retrieve nothing, permanently, for
/// exactly the questions people actually ask. The floor's job is "is there
/// enough signal to say anything", not "did this come from curated prose".
///
/// **This floor applies only to this hook's unsolicited injection.**
/// `loom knowledge context` is NOT floor-gated — it prints what it found
/// because a human asked for exactly that — and the stage spawn brief is NOT
/// floor-gated either, because an autonomous session should see the best
/// available retrieval even when every match is weak. Both live outside this
/// file (`commands::knowledge::context`, `orchestrator::signals`), so this
