//! Resolving the source graph for a query's overlay, and detecting the A.11
//! degraded mode: a non-empty semantic revision whose RESOLVED graph —
//! base layer plus whatever overlay this query is scoped to — came back
//! with no content at all. A missing base alone is not this condition: a
//! dirty working tree never publishes a base (bases are immutable and
//! revision-keyed; see `graph_store.rs`'s module doc), so "no base for the
//! current revision, but the overlay covers it" is the ordinary, healthy
//! state of any checkout someone is actively working in, not a fault.
//!
//! Split out of `retrieve.rs` so the top-level pipeline in
//! [`super::retrieve_for_stage`] stays a readable sequence of steps rather
//! than growing this reasoning inline. See
//! `doc/PROPOSAL-retrieval-precision.md` §A.11 for the design this
//! implements.

/// Load the resolved source graph for `query`'s overlay, degrading to `None`
/// on any error, alongside an A.11 degradation message when the base layer
/// for a non-empty semantic revision could not be found.
///
/// `overlay.resolve` always yields a `(plan, stage)` pair, so this always asks
/// [`GraphStore::resolved`] for the overlay-applied view — never `None` for
/// the stage. That distinction matters on its own: with `None`, `resolved`
/// reads only the base layer, and a base miss there becomes an *empty* graph
/// rather than a missing one, silently dropping an overlay the query should
/// have read. [`OverlayScope::Local`] resolves to the `(plan, stage)` address
/// `local_overlay_key` computes and `loom map` writes (`commands/map.rs`) —
/// the only production writer of that overlay today — so a `Local`-scoped
/// query is what lets a caller see a working tree that no merge has
/// published a base for.
///
/// Retrieval itself never builds or refreshes this graph: `resolve_catalog`
/// calls `refresh` with `structural_only = true`, which skips the semantic
/// reconcile on every call this pipeline makes. So this function only ever
/// reads what a prior `loom map` run, or a merge, already wrote for
/// `semantic_revision`.
///
/// **Real, currently-reachable degraded mode:** a non-empty
/// `semantic_revision` names a layer `state.json` claims was built, but
/// NEITHER half of the resolved view can back that claim: no base file was
/// found for the revision (`graph_store::GraphStore::resolved`'s base half is
/// `unwrap_or_default()` over `load_base`, so a missing base file resolves to
/// an *empty* base rather than an error) AND nothing published an overlay to
/// cover for it either, so the resolved graph has no files at all.
/// [`degraded_reason`] turns THAT combination into the message
/// `super::build_pack_request` carries out to `ContextPack::degraded`. A
/// missing base alone is NOT this condition — see this module's doc comment
/// and [`degraded_reason`]'s own — so a checkout with a healthy overlay, or
/// one with a genuinely empty published base, both read as `Semantic:
/// current`, exactly as they should; only a checkout where the source
/// channel has genuinely nothing to answer with gets flagged.

/// elsewhere in the pack, so flagging it here too would print a
/// `DEGRADED:` banner on every unmapped checkout forever, for a condition
/// that is not a degradation at all; skip it.
///
/// Otherwise this is NOT simply `graph.base_revision.is_empty()` — that was
/// the bug. `GraphStore::resolved` returns `base ∪ overlay`
/// (`graph_store.rs`), and a missing base is the ORDINARY state of a dirty
/// working tree: bases are immutable and revision-keyed, so
/// `refresh::semantic::try_reconcile_semantic` deliberately builds a `_local`
/// OVERLAY instead of a base whenever the tree is dirty — it CANNOT publish
/// one. "state names the current revision, no base file exists for it,
/// content is served from the overlay" is therefore the normal, healthy
/// steady state of any checkout someone is actually working in, not a fault
/// — testing `base_revision` alone flagged every such checkout as degraded
/// forever, which is both a banner nobody can ever clear (a warning that is
/// always on is a warning nobody reads) and, far more importantly, a live
/// input to [`crate::commands::hook::reconcile_graph::spawn_if_needed`]: that
/// function fires a detached full-repository tree-sitter rebuild on `stale OR
/// degraded`, so this predicate does not merely choose a display string — it
/// decides whether every single prompt in every checkout with a dirty tree
/// (i.e. nearly all of them) starts an unbounded background rebuild, throttled
/// only by the reconcile debounce lock.
///
/// The honest test is two-part: a base was found (`base_revision` non-empty —
/// note this stays true even for a genuinely empty, zero-file base: a
/// published layer over a project with no matching source files is current,
/// not degraded), OR the resolved view has ANY content at all (`files`
/// non-empty — an overlay alone can supply this with no base present). Only
/// when NEITHER holds — no base was found for this revision AND nothing else
/// covered for it — is there truly nothing to answer a query with, which is
/// the one case worth surfacing.
