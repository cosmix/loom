//! Cross-file symbol resolution and bounded reverse-impact traversal.
//!
//! Extraction is per file, so a call to a function defined elsewhere arrives
//! here as an [`EdgeProvenance::Inferred`] edge pointing at
//! [`UNRESOLVED_TARGET`](crate::context::source_graph::UNRESOLVED_TARGET): the
//! grammar that parsed the call site never saw the definition. This module is
//! the only place holding the whole graph at once, so it is the only place that
//! can turn some of those guesses into targets.
//!
//! **What it may claim.** An unresolved edge may be retargeted when the name it
//! recorded has exactly one definition in the entire graph, published at
//! [`UNIQUE_MATCH_CONFIDENCE`] — above the extraction-time ceiling, below
//! certainty. A call written with a path — `crate::a::b()`, `super::b()`,
//! `Widget::new()` — is matched on that path, which carries more evidence than
//! the bare name at its end: the qualified spelling is tried against every
//! node's scope, and failing that the qualifier is matched onto files and the
//! name is looked up only inside them. A qualifier naming nothing here is a call
//! into a dependency, so the edge stays a gap — resolving it against a namesake
//! elsewhere in the graph would be a fabrication. Imports are matched against
//! file paths by the rules in `paths`, and both only ever resolve when exactly
//! one candidate is left.
//!
//! **What it may never claim.**
//!
//! - *Never a complete call graph.* Resolution raises confidence where it can
//!   justify it and leaves the rest alone; [`ResolutionStats`] exists so a caller
//!   reports that residue instead of implying completeness.
//! - *Two candidates is ambiguity, not a coin flip.* Two definitions of one name
//!   leave the edge unresolved. Guessing would be indistinguishable from knowing,
//!   which is the failure this subsystem exists to avoid. The single exception is
//!   an `impl` block, which is indexed under its type's name without defining it
//!   (see `SymbolIndex::definitions`) — everything else contests.
//! - *A [`EdgeProvenance::Parser`] edge is never rewritten or downgraded, and
//!   nothing is ever promoted to `Parser`.* That provenance means one grammar saw
//!   both endpoints in one file; name matching cannot manufacture it.
//! - *A resolved edge stays `Inferred`.* Retargeting changes what an edge points
//!   at and how far to trust it, never what evidence produced it.
//!
//! [`impact`](fn@impact) walks the result backwards and reports, for every node
//! reached, the confidence of the *weakest* edge on the path taken — so a chain
//! passing through one guess is never presented as stronger than that guess. It
//! lives in the private `impact` submodule and is re-exported here, so every
//! caller keeps one path: `crate::context::resolve::impact`.
