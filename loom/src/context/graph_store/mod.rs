//! Layered persistence for the derived source graph.
//!
//! ## Why layers exist
//!
//! Parallel stages run in separate worktrees off one repository. If they shared
//! a mutable graph, a stage would see half of a sibling's edits — worse than
//! seeing none, because there is no way to tell which half. So the graph is
//! split in two:
//!
//! - a **base layer**, keyed by the source revision it was built from, written
//!   once by the host and thereafter immutable. `.loom/cache/context-v1/graph/base/`
//!   under the canonical main project root, shared by every worktree;
//! - a per-stage **overlay**, under `.work/context/<plan>/<stage>/`, holding
//!   only the files that stage changed.
//!
//! A read is `overlay ∪ (base − overlay's files)`: an overlay entry shadows the
//! base entry for the same path wholesale, never merges with it. Partial merges
//! are what produce a graph that describes no revision that ever existed.
//!
//! Nothing here builds a graph — `crate::context::refresh` does that — and
//! nothing here decides *when* to write one; that is
//! `crate::context::refresh::source_graph::reconcile_source_graph`'s job. This
//! module owns only the layout, the layering rule, and canonical serialization.
