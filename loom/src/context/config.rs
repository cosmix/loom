//! The one tunables surface for retrieval.
//!
//! Every threshold the ranking, packing and hook paths depend on lives here as
//! a field of [`RetrievalConfig`], loaded once per retrieval and threaded down
//! as a `&RetrievalConfig` parameter. No global, no `OnceLock`, no re-read
//! partway through a pipeline: two callers in one process must be able to
//! retrieve against different roots without one silently inheriting the
//! other's tunables.
//!
//! ## The file
//!
//! `<main project root>/.loom/config.toml`, table `[retrieval]`, every key
//! optional:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [retrieval]
//! stop_df_ratio = 0.10
//! stop_rescue_max_ratio = 0.25
//! min_query_token_len = 3
//! df_ident_max = 5
//! test_path_factor = 0.4
//! min_knowledge_terms = 2
//! knowledge_curated_prior = 5.0
//! prompt_budget_tokens = 1500
//! stage_brief_budget_tokens = 3000
//! max_payload_bytes = 16384
//! keep_base_graphs = 3
//! reconcile_debounce_secs = 600
//! reconcile_stale_lock_secs = 1800
//! prose_roots = ["doc"]
//! ```
//!
//! **This is not `.loom/work/config.toml`.** That file is loom's plan and
//! orchestration state (see [`crate::fs::work_dir`]) and has nothing to do with
//! retrieval; the two are different files, in different directories, read by
//! different code. Do not merge them.
//!
//! ## Never an error
//!
//! [`RetrievalConfig::load`] returns [`RetrievalConfig::default`] for an absent
//! file, an unreadable file, a file that is not TOML, and a `[retrieval]` value
//! that is not a table. Retrieval is on the hot path of signal generation and
//! the prompt hook, where a hard failure costs an agent its Knowledge Brief; a
//! typo in an optional tuning file must never be able to do that. Out-of-range
//! values clamp or fall back per field rather than rejecting the file, so one
//! bad key cannot discard twelve good ones.
