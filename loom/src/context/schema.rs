//! Shared type contract for the deterministic context retrieval subsystem.
//!
//! Every module under [`crate::context`] — and the knowledge chunker/catalog in
//! [`crate::fs::knowledge`] — compiles against the types defined here. There is
//! deliberately no model call and no network access anywhere in this subsystem:
//! a [`ContextPack`] is a pure function of the bytes on disk plus the query.
//!
//! Token counts are **estimates** ([`estimate_tokens`]), never tokenizer output.
//! They are used only to keep a pack inside its budget, so a conservative
//! four-bytes-per-token approximation is sufficient and keeps the crate free of
//! a tokenizer dependency.
