//! End-to-end coverage: a real source-graph overlay on disk, read all the way
//! through `retrieve_for_stage` into a packed `ItemKind::SourceNode` item.
//!
//! Every other source-channel test builds its `ResolvedGraph` by hand and
//! calls `pack`/`rank_source` directly (see `pack_source.rs`,
//! `rank_source.rs`, `rank_source_matching.rs`). None of them exercise
//! `load_resolved_graph`'s own wiring — the overlay address it computes, or
//! `retrieve_for_stage`'s call into it. If `load_resolved_graph` degraded to
//! `None` on every call, or resolved the wrong `(plan, stage)` address, every
//! one of those tests would still pass unchanged. This test writes a real
//! overlay file at the exact address `OverlayScope::Local` resolves to and
//! drives the whole pipeline against it, so it fails on either mistake, and
//! it fails too if `pack` ever stops emitting source items.

// missing base alone is NOT degraded — bases are immutable and revision-keyed
// (`graph_store.rs`), so a dirty working tree can never publish one, and
// `refresh::semantic::try_reconcile_semantic` deliberately builds a `_local`
// overlay instead; "no base for the current revision, served from the
// overlay" is the ordinary, healthy state of a checkout someone is actively
// working in. Getting this wrong is not just a display bug: `degraded` is a
// live input to `reconcile_graph::spawn_if_needed` (`stale OR degraded`), so
// misreporting it means every prompt against a dirty tree trips a background
// full-repository rebuild.
//
// These write `state.json` directly with `ContextStore::update_state` rather
