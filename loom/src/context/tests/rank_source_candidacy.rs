//! The source channel's lexical candidacy floor (A.24): a node that earned no
//! exact rung is a candidate only when the prompt named its symbol.
//!
//! Every query here is a measured specimen from this repository, and the
//! property they pin together is one sentence: an ordinary English word cannot
//! put an unrelated symbol at rank 1. Before this floor, `how do I configure the
//! hooks so sessions get the right settings` ranked `configure_loom_hooks`
//! FIRST, above every curated chunk about configuring hooks.
