//! Building and persisting the semantic (source-graph) layer.
//!
//! [`reconcile_source_graph`] is the driver: it walks the repository's
//! tracked files, runs the extractor registry over whatever changed, and
//! persists the resulting [`GraphLayer`] through [`GraphStore`]. Nothing here
//! ever silently drops a file — an unreadable file, an oversized one, and a
//! parse error all keep a reported entry (see [`unreadable_entry`] and
//! `crate::context::extract::extract_file`).
//!
//! ## Known gaps
//!
//! An overlay cannot express a deletion: [`GraphStore::resolved`] computes
//! `overlay ∪ base`, so a file the stage deleted keeps its base entry, and a
//! view over the resolved graph (e.g. `loom map --outline <deleted-file>`)
//! still prints the old outline. Fixing this needs a tombstone concept in
//! `graph_store.rs`, which this module does not own.
