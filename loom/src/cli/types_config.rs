//! `loom config` CLI args: read or write a key in `~/.loom/config.toml`.
//!
//! Split out from `types.rs` for the same reason as `types_ops.rs` /
//! `types_stage.rs` / `types_memory.rs`: the top-level `Commands` enum sits at
//! its line budget, so a new subcommand's flags live in their own file.
//! `Commands::Config` wraps [`ConfigArgs`] as a tuple variant
//! (`Config(ConfigArgs)`) rather than following `Map`/`Usage`'s
//! struct-with-`#[command(flatten)]` form — clap 4 supports both identically,
//! and the tuple form costs three fewer lines here.
