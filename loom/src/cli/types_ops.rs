//! Operational CLI command types: plans, sessions, worktrees, and the
//! deterministic context/hook entry points.
//!
//! Split out of `types.rs` for the same reason as `types_memory.rs` and
//! `types_stage.rs`: the top-level `Commands` enum is large enough on its own,
//! and every new subcommand family that lands beside it costs the file lines it
//! does not have. `types.rs` re-exports everything here, so callers keep naming
//! a single `cli::types` surface.
