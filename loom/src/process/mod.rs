/// # Why this exists
///
/// The orchestrator's poll loop is single-threaded: it syncs stage state,
/// spawns ready stages, and handles session teardown in one sequence. A
/// subprocess that never returns therefore does not merely fail one
/// operation — it stops *all* orchestration, silently, with no further log
/// output, while the daemon's socket thread keeps answering `loom status`
/// as if everything were healthy.
///
/// Window management is the dangerous case. On macOS `osascript` sends an
/// Apple Event and blocks with no timeout of its own: a TCC Automation
/// prompt (which a detached daemon cannot surface), a terminal-side modal,
/// or an unresponsive terminal app all park the call indefinitely. Linux is
/// less exposed — the `wmctrl`/`xdotool` paths are `which`-guarded and no-op
/// when the tools are absent — but an unresponsive X server can stall them
/// the same way.
///
/// Every external command issued from the orchestrator loop must therefore be
/// bounded. A timed-out teardown is a warning; an unbounded one is a hang.
///
/// # Output size
///
/// stdout/stderr are drained concurrently on dedicated threads while the main
/// thread waits on the child, so output larger than the OS pipe buffer
/// (~64KB) cannot make the child block on write and stall past the deadline.
///
/// # Deadline scope
///
/// `timeout` bounds the *whole call*, not just the child's run time: once the
/// child exits, collecting its buffered stdout/stderr from the reader
/// threads still has to happen before this function can return, and a
/// descendant that inherited a pipe and outlived the direct child can hold
/// that collection open indefinitely. The remaining time budget (`timeout`
/// minus time already spent) bounds that collection too; running past it is
/// reported the same way as the child itself running past the deadline.

///
/// **RACE CONDITION HAZARD**: This function is subject to PID reuse races. Between the time
/// you check if a PID is alive and the time you act on that information, the process may
/// have exited and the OS may have reassigned that PID to a new, unrelated process.
///
/// This means `is_process_alive(pid) == true` only tells you "a process with this PID exists
/// right now", NOT "the process I'm tracking is still running". The new process may be
/// completely unrelated to the one you're monitoring.
///
/// **Safe usage patterns:**
/// - Only use this for informational purposes (logging, diagnostics)
/// - DO NOT use this as the sole basis for sending signals or making state transitions
/// - Prefer tracking processes via process handles or file locks when possible
/// - If you must use PIDs, combine with additional identity checks (start time, parent PID, etc.)
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `pid` - The process ID to check
///
/// # Returns
/// * `true` - The process exists (regardless of signal permission)
/// * `false` - The process doesn't exist or the PID is invalid
///
/// # Example
/// ```ignore
/// use loom::process::is_process_alive;
///
/// let our_pid = std::process::id();
/// assert!(is_process_alive(our_pid));
///
/// // Non-existent PID
