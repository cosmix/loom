//! Knowledge map operations for curated codebase knowledge.
//!
//! Design principle: Claude Code already has Glob, Grep, Read, LSP tools.
//! We curate high-level knowledge that helps agents know WHERE to look,
//! not raw indexing.
//!
//! Knowledge is tiered: a generated `INDEX.md` (tier 0) points at the seven
//! curated summary files (tier 1), which link to per-category topic files
//! (tier 2, e.g. `architecture/merge-flow.md`). Directories created before the
//! hierarchy existed stay flat and keep working — see [`types::KnowledgeLayout`].
