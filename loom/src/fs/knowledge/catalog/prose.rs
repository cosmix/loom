//! Index project prose (`doc/**/*.md` by default) into the same structural
//! catalog the curated knowledge tree feeds.
//!
//! Today, a file with no tree-sitter grammar produces only a bare file node
//! (`crate::context::extract::lexical`) and the source ranker drops file
//! nodes outright, so design docs, proposals and plans under `doc/` are
//! unreachable by retrieval no matter how relevant their content. This module
//! closes that gap the same way the knowledge tree already is reachable:
//! chunk prose files with the existing heading chunker
//! ([`crate::fs::knowledge::chunker::chunk_file`]) and fold the result into
//! [`crate::fs::knowledge::catalog::Catalog::chunks`].
//!
//! ## Why the `prose:` prefix
//!
//! Every chunk id this module produces is prefixed [`PROSE_ID_PREFIX`]. Two
//! independent reasons make that non-negotiable:
//!
//! - **Collision-proofing.** A curated chunk id is derived from a path
//!   relative to the *knowledge root* (`architecture.md#topic#0`); a prose
//!   chunk id is derived from a path relative to the *project root*
//!   (`doc/design.md#topic#0`). Two different roots can produce the same
//!   relative path for unrelated files, and a curated author cannot see, let
//!   alone avoid, what an arbitrary project doc happens to be named. The
//!   prefix makes the two id spaces disjoint by construction instead of by
//!   convention.
//! - **Channel-of-origin signal.** The Knowledge Brief a stage or prompt
//!   receives renders chunk ids as-is (see `pack.rs`'s item rendering). A
//!   reader who sees `prose:doc/design.md#...` knows immediately this is an
//!   indexed project doc, not curated, reviewed knowledge — the same
//!   distinction [`crate::context::schema::LifecycleState`] draws for staleness,
//!   drawn here for provenance instead.
//!
//! ## Why resolution is derived here, not threaded as a parameter
//!
//! `catalog::build(root)`, `ingest(knowledge_root)`,
//! `fingerprint_tree(knowledge_root)`, `evaluate(store, knowledge_root)` and
//! `refresh(store, knowledge_root, bool)` all take only the knowledge root.
//! `loom/src/commands/knowledge/sync.rs:26` calls `refresh(&store,
//! &knowledge_root, structural_only)` and is not part of this change, so no
//! signature in that chain may grow a `project_root` or `prose_roots`
//! parameter without touching a call site outside this module's ownership.
//! [`sources_for_knowledge_root`] instead re-derives everything a prose scan
//! needs — project root, config, which roots exist — from the one value
//! every caller already has. Both `catalog::build` (structural chunks) and
//! `crate::context::fingerprint::fingerprint_tree` (structural revision) call
//! it, so the two can never disagree about what is indexed: there is exactly
//! one function that decides "what counts as prose for this knowledge root",
//! and both sides of the freshness contract call it.
