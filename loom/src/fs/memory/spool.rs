//! Per-worktree spool for memory entries a sandboxed stage cannot write directly.
//!
//! `loom memory note` (and its siblings) normally write straight to
//! `.loom/work/memory/<stage>.md` via [`super::append_entry`]. Inside a
//! sandboxed worktree that write fails: `.loom/work` is a symlink to the main
//! repo's `.loom/work`, the generated sandbox grants
//! `Read(.loom/work/memory/**)` but no matching `Edit`, and the kernel
//! refuses the write with EROFS or `PermissionDenied`.
//!
//! This module gives the sandboxed path somewhere writable to land instead:
//! `<worktree_root>/.loom/memory-spool.jsonl`, which sits inside the
//! worktree's own write boundary and needs no new sandbox grant. The loom
//! daemon runs outside the sandbox, so on its poll loop it calls
//! [`drain_spool`] to move every pending entry into the real journal file
//! and empties the spool. Because the daemon is trusted and the spool is
//! agent-writable, every host-side open goes through `open_regular_no_follow`
//! (`fs::safe_read`), which refuses a planted symlink instead of following it.
//!
//! Deliberately absent from the spool payload: a stage id. Attribution of a
//! drained entry comes from *which worktree* the daemon drained it from, not
//! from anything the entry claims about itself - a sandboxed agent cannot
//! forge the worktree it is running in, but it could trivially forge a
//! field. Keeping the payload stage-less makes that the only path.
