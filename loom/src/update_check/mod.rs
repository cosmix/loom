//! Update notification — a stderr line when a newer release exists, never an
//! installer. `loom self-update` (`crate::commands::self_update`) stays the
//! only thing that writes a new binary; this module only reads a small state
//! file and, at most, spawns a detached child to refresh it.
//!
//! # The hot path takes no network call
//!
//! `loom` is invoked constantly from Claude Code hooks, so a synchronous
//! fetch on every launch would be a latency disaster. [`notify_and_maybe_refresh`]
//! only ever reads `update-state.json` from disk; the actual GitHub request
//! happens in a DETACHED child (`loom __update-refresh`, [`run_refresh`]),
//! spawned at most once per stale interval and never awaited.
//!
//! # Failures are silent everywhere
//!
//! A network error, an unreadable or torn state file, or an unresolvable home
//! directory must never make a loom command fail, panic, or print noise. None
//! of the IO in this module unwraps or expects; every fallible read collapses
//! to "absent" and every fallible write is best-effort.
//!
//! # The notice goes to stderr, never stdout
//!
//! Every loom command's stdout is somebody's input (`loom plan verify --json`,
//! `loom usage`, `loom config -k <key>`), so the notice goes to stderr; the
//! argv exclusion list in `main.rs` (`suppresses_update_check`) is a second
//! line of defence, not the first.
//!
//! # Exactly one fetcher
//!
//! Two invocations of loom racing this module is the common case, since loom
//! runs from every hook. `schedule_refresh` publishes a lock file before
//! spawning so at most one detached fetcher is in flight per stale interval;
//! a fetch that fails still stamps `last_checked` so a network outage backs
//! off instead of respawning on every invocation.
