//! Drains the spools a sandboxed worktree writes when it cannot reach the
//! daemon: memory entries into the canonical journal, and stage-control
//! requests (`loom stage block`, `loom stage dispute-criteria`) into the
//! daemon's own handlers.
//!
//! `loom memory note` writes directly to `.work/memory/<stage>.md` via
//! [`crate::fs::memory::append_entry`]. Inside a sandboxed worktree that
//! write is refused (`.work` is a symlink out of the worktree; the sandbox
//! grants no write there), so the CLI falls back to appending the entry to
//! `<worktree>/.loom/memory-spool.jsonl` instead — see [`crate::fs::memory`]
//! for the full spool design. This module is the daemon side: on every poll
//! tick it drains every stage's pending spool into the real journal.
//!
//! Attribution is derived ONLY from which worktree a spool file was found
//! in, never from the spool payload itself (which deliberately carries no
//! stage id). Memory files are injected into OTHER stages' prompts by
//! `orchestrator/signals/generate.rs`, so mis-attributing an entry would be a
//! prompt-injection channel between stages. The stage-request spool
//! (`crate::fs::stage_request`) is attributed the same way and for a sharper
//! reason still: a misattributed request would block or dispute the wrong
//! stage.
