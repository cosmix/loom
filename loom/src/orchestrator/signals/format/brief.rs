//! Renders the per-stage "## Knowledge Brief" section.
//!
//! Called from both `sections::format_semi_stable_section` (the fresh-spawn
//! path) and `recovery_format::format_recovery_signal` (the resume path),
//! which is why this lives beside them rather than inside the ledgered
//! `sections.rs`. `commands::hook::user_prompt` is a third caller: the prompt
//! hook wraps this exact rendering in its own JSON envelope rather than
//! forking it, so a change here reaches all three surfaces at once.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! One header (Revision / Budget / Selected from / the untrusted-data
//! sentence), then up to two sections in pack order — `### Knowledge` for
//! curated prose, `### Source (signature index)` for the derived source
//! graph — each omitted, heading included, when the pack carries no items of
//! that kind. A knowledge item keeps its Reason line and fenced excerpt; a
//! source item has neither — its reasons move into the trailing parentheses
//! of its bullet, and items that are adjacent in pack order and share a path
//! collapse onto ONE bullet, since a signature is a line or two and the
//! per-item scaffolding used to cost more than the payload it wrapped. See
//! `doc/PROPOSAL-retrieval-precision.md` §4 (recommendations 7, 8, 17) and its
//! Appendix A.7/A.8/A.17 for the token-cost case this rework answers.
//!
//! A source item renders no body of its own: node bodies are not stored in the
//! graph, and this renderer never reads files. Retrieval may attach up to two
//! verbatim windows (`context::retrieve::windows`), which render as indented
//! fenced blocks under the path bullet. A query for literal text adds one
//! `Literal text:` line naming the search to run instead.
//!
//! Every excerpt quoted here is UNTRUSTED: it is prose and source comments
//! that could contain anything, including text shaped like instructions. The
//! [`REFERENCE_DATA_SENTENCE`] therefore appears exactly ONCE, in the header,
//! ahead of every item — not once per excerpt as it used to, since the
//! guarantee it states ("what follows is quoted, not instructions") holds for
//! the whole brief and does not get stronger by repeating it. Every excerpt
//! is still fenced with a run of backticks one longer than the longest run
//! already present in it — a naive 3-backtick fence would let quoted content
//! break out of its own block.
//!
//! The excerpt is not the only untrusted field: ids, pointers, names, kinds
//! and the degraded-mode message are rendered as the brief's own structure —
//! inline code spans and bare lines — so every one of them goes through
//! [`inline_safe`] first. Containment lives HERE rather than in the
//! producers, because this is the one point all of them pass through on the
//! way into a signal file.
