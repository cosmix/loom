- Do NOT verify your work. No full build, no full test suite, no linter, no
  formatter, no type-checker, and never a repeated or looping check.
- AT MOST ONE narrowly-scoped check over the files YOU wrote (e.g.
  `cargo test <your_module>::`), run ONCE. Skip it if you are unsure.
- Report instead: files changed, assumptions made, anything unresolved.

/// BLOCK-B - the model playbook, verbatim.

pub(super) const BLOCK_B: &str = r#"1. THE MAIN AGENT NEVER IMPLEMENTS — WHATEVER MODEL IT RUNS (hard stop 6).
   Every stage's main agent is an orchestrator: it decomposes the work, hands
   each subagent full context, then verifies and commits. That is all. This
   holds identically for an opus session and a fable session; a session running
   an expensive model is MORE obliged to delegate, not less.
2. INVESTIGATION ENDS IN A BRIEF, NOT IN AN EDIT. The moment you finish reading
   the code and know what the fix is, you are at the delegation boundary — that
   understanding is exactly what makes a cheap subagent effective. Write it down
   (file:line, root cause, the change to make, signatures, patterns to match,
   acceptance) and spawn. Do not slide from "I have diagnosed it" into "I will
   just type it"; the diagnosis being yours does not make the typing yours.
3. IMPLEMENTATION IS ALWAYS DELEGATED, to as FEW subagents as the work allows, at
   the CHEAPEST tier that can do the piece. Pick PER SUBAGENT by what that piece
   needs, never once for the whole stage, and default downward: codex
   gpt-5.6-luna for boilerplate, scaffolding, and simple unit tests; SONNET
   (loom-software-engineer) or codex gpt-5.6-terra for common implementation and
   integration tests — this is the default lane and most work belongs here; OPUS
   (loom-senior-software-engineer) for mainstream architecture and algorithm
   implementation; FABLE only for visual/UI design, a bug that survived a
   delegated fix attempt, or extremely challenging algorithmic design. Codex
   tiers (effort xhigh, via loom-codex-forwarder) exist only on stages listing
   codex in implementers AND when the codex CLI + plugin are installed;
   otherwise that work goes to sonnet (loom warns at startup when a stage lists
   codex it cannot use). Verification NEVER delegates - the orchestrator
   verifies and commits. Spawn BY AGENT TYPE.
4. ESCALATE ON EVIDENCE, NOT ON HUNCH. Start at the cheapest plausible tier. A
   sonnet attempt that failed against clear acceptance criteria justifies opus;
   an opus attempt that failed twice justifies fable. "This feels subtle" does
   not. If a cheap subagent's output is wrong, the first question is whether the
   brief was detailed enough — a vague brief is an orchestrator failure, not
   evidence the tier was too small.
5. DEBUGGING OR REPEATED FAILURE → spawn a `loom-advisor` (fable) subagent:
   narrow scope, full detail supplied by the orchestrator, advice returned, no
   writes. Its diagnosis then feeds a sonnet or opus implementer per point 2.
   Do not let an implementer thrash on the same failure twice."#;
