//! Build the briefing an adjudication session is given for one dispute.
//!
//! It has two parts:
//! - `instructions`: what the session judges, and how it records the verdict.
//! - `evidence`: the stage definition, plan acceptance criteria, diff of the
//!   evidence commit, worktree listing, and failure output.
//!
//! The whole thing is hard-capped to roughly 100 KiB (see `truncate`), with
//! the instructions never trimmed. `signals/adjudication.rs` wraps the result
//! in a signal file; nothing here writes anything.
