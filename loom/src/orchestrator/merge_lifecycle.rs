//! Ordered lifecycle around a stage merge, and the only door to post-merge
//! cleanup.
//!
//! Loom's costliest recurring defect is the *phantom merge*: recording a stage
//! as merged, or destroying its branch, without proving in git that its commits
//! landed. `auto_merge::attempt_auto_merge` used to run cleanup inside its own
//! success arms, deleting the worktree and branch *before* its caller could
//! verify ancestry — and the caller derives a missing `completed_commit` from
//! exactly that branch. This module makes the ordering structural:
//!
//! ```text
//! overlay reconcile -> merge attempt -> verify merged ancestry
//!   -> base reconcile & publish -> mark state and release dependents
//!   -> cleanup worktree/overlay
//! ```
//!
//! The merge attempt, the ancestry verification and the state marking stay with
//! the callers, which hold the orchestrator handle and the stage-file lock.
//! Everything around them lives here, and [`MergeLifecycle::cleanup`] is the
//! single path by which a merge caller may reach `cleanup_after_merge`.
