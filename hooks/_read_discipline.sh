# _read_discipline.sh - Shared read-discipline core for read-guard.sh (Task
# C, the Read tool) and poll-guard.sh (Task D, Bash-side cat/head/tail/sed
# and the repeated-command counter).
#
# This is a SOURCED LIBRARY, not a hook - it is never registered as a
# PreToolUse entry, exactly like _common.sh. Source _common.sh first (for
# strip_embedded_content/loom_tokenize_command/loom_tokens_*/loom_debug/
# is_ancestor/loom_deny_enabled), then this file.
#
# What lives here: the 400-line ceiling constant, the binary/image
# extension skip list, the verification-runner exemption set, the outline
# fetch, and the warn/deny queuing helpers every rule in both hooks goes
# through. The actual "is this read too big / a repeat / tier-1 knowledge"
# decision tree is loom_read_discipline_check(), the ONE place both hooks
# call so their rules 1-3 can never drift apart. The ledger read/write/cap
# helpers (_loom_ledger_append, _loom_reads_full_count_and_ts,
# _loom_reads_range_count, _loom_polls_count) live in the sourced
# hooks/_read_ledger.sh, split out purely for size - this file sources it
# below, so read-guard.sh/poll-guard.sh get it transitively.
#
# Bash 3.2+ compatible (macOS default), same constraint as _common.sh: no
# associative arrays, no `${arr[-1]}`, no `${var,,}`. Every `${arr[@]}`
# expansion is guarded by a `${#arr[@]}` count check first - an EMPTY array
# expanded under `set -u` on bash 3.2 is a hard error (see
# prefer-modern-tools.sh's comment on this exact bug).
