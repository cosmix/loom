=== LOOM CONTEXT (prepended automatically; your task follows the TASK marker) ===

You are implementing one slice of a loom-orchestrated stage inside a git worktree. That
worktree is your boundary. An orchestrator verifies and commits your work; you do neither.

NAVIGATE WITH THE SOURCE GRAPH INSTEAD OF PAGING FILES.
Loom keeps a tree-sitter index of this repository. Each command below answers in well under a
second, never writes inside your worktree, and works from any directory in the tree. Use them
first, and open a file only once one of them has told you which lines matter:

  loom map --find-all <symbol>      every definition of a name: path, line, kind
  loom map --outline <file>         the symbols in a file, with line ranges and signatures
  loom map --impact <symbol|path>   what reaches it, with path confidence
  loom knowledge context --query "<question>" --budget-tokens 1500
                                    ranked project knowledge plus matching source
  rg -n '<pattern>' <path>          literal text search
  sed -n '<first>,<last>p' <file>   the exact lines a lookup pointed you at

Two things to expect from these commands, neither of which is a failure. They may print
`warning: could not refresh ...` or `warning: failed to refresh the context cache ...`, because
the cache they try to refresh lives outside your sandbox - the command still answers from the
published index, so do not retry it and do not report it as a block. And that index reflects your
branch point, so it will not show edits you or another agent made during this session; read a file
directly when you have already changed it.

DO NOT read CLAUDE.md. It instructs a different agent; nothing in it is addressed to you.
DO NOT read doc/loom/knowledge/ file by file. It is a ~200k-token corpus, and
`loom knowledge context --query` is how you query it. Ask it a question; do not read the library.

WRITE ONLY THE FILES YOUR TASK ASSIGNS YOU. Everything else in the tree is read-only to you.
NEVER write anything under .work/ or .loom/ - .loom/work/ (or the legacy .work/) is a symlink to
state shared with other running stages, and the rest of .loom/ is orchestrator-owned spool/cache
data.
NEVER run git: not add, not commit, not checkout, not stash, not restore.
DO NOT VERIFY. No full build, no test suite, no linter, no formatter, no type-checker, and never
a repeated or looping check. At most ONE narrowly-scoped check over the files you changed, run
once; skip it if you are unsure. The orchestrator compiles, tests, lints, and fixes.

FINISH BY REPORTING: files changed, assumptions you made, anything you could not resolve.

# macOS refuses to apply a second Seatbelt profile to an already-sandboxed
# process. Inside a stage session's Bash sandbox every command codex wraps in
# /usr/bin/sandbox-exec (its workspace-write AND read-only modes both do) dies
# with `sandbox-exec: sandbox_apply: Operation not permitted` while codex and
# the companion still exit 0. The companion hardcodes workspace-write and
# exposes no override, so when nesting is refused the wrapper calls
# `codex exec` directly with --sandbox danger-full-access: the outer sandbox
# (worktree + granted paths, strict domain allowlist) stays the boundary, the
# same containment any other subagent's Bash call has. PATH lookup on purpose:
# the probe only chooses a lane, and the tests stub it. On Linux there is no
# sandbox-exec, so the companion path (codex's own bubblewrap nested inside the
# stage sandbox) is unchanged. The probe is a heuristic: it asks whether ANY
# profile can be applied, which is the refusal macOS produces; a host that
# accepted this trivial profile yet rejected codex's own would still fall
# through to the companion path and fail silently as before.
