description: Distill important session insights into doc/loom/knowledge
---
Add any information that is deemed important for a future agent or human engineer working on this project to `doc/loom/knowledge`, focusing on architectural insights, conventions, and mistakes made (and their resolution if available).

**Start from the grouped worklist.** Run `loom memory pending --group` and work the groups in order: corrections (text starting `stale-knowledge:`, target printed as `<file>#<heading>`), then mistakes (`mistake:`), decisions, other. When a mistake is a recurrence of one already in the tree, record a proposal for a hook or a `loom plan verify` check in `concerns.md` instead of another paragraph, and resolve the memory as `merged`.

**Corrections first.** Apply EVERY `corrections`-group entry. Correct files IN PLACE with `loom knowledge replace-section <file> "<heading>" "<corrected body>"` (body WITHOUT its `##` heading line) — never `loom knowledge update` for an existing claim, which only adds to a file rather than fixing what is already there.

Route each new insight to the right file:

- `architecture.md` — component relationships, data flow, module/dependency graph
- `patterns.md` — reusable architectural patterns found in the codebase
- `conventions.md` — naming, structure, and coding standards
- `mistakes.md` — what went wrong, the misleading signal, root cause, prevention rule, and fix
- `concerns.md` — tech debt, warnings, known issues
- `stack.md` / `entry-points.md` — dependencies/tooling and key files to read first

If `doc/loom/knowledge/INDEX.md` exists, the layout is hierarchical: each file above is a tier-1 summary, and per-category directories (`architecture/`, `mistakes/`, ...) hold tier-2 topic files for deeper detail. Route by size — a finding that fits in roughly 40 lines or fewer goes inline into the tier-1 file above; anything larger goes to `loom knowledge update <category>/<slug>`, leaving a 2-4 line summary plus a link in the tier-1 file. `INDEX.md` regenerates automatically on every knowledge write, so there is nothing to run at the end.

Consumers of what you write here do not read these files end to end: each stage session gets a per-stage Knowledge Brief that `loom knowledge context` assembles by pulling in whichever sections retrieval judged relevant to that stage's task. Write to be retrieved in slices, not read start to finish — prefer one self-contained `##` section per finding, naming the concrete symbols and paths inline, because a section is the unit retrieval selects. A finding scattered across sections, or missing its own heading, may never surface to the agent that needs it.

**Give every memory taken from an insight a receipt.** After the `loom knowledge update`/`replace-section` call that used a Note/Decision/Question entry, run `loom memory resolve <id> --outcome promoted --target <file#heading>`; use `merged` when it folded into an existing section, `discarded --reason "..."` when it was a duplicate or wrong, `deferred --reason "..."` when it needs evidence not available now. Finish with `loom memory pending --strict` and resolve whatever it lists — this also runs standalone, any time, not only at plan end.

Only record what is non-obvious and durable. Do NOT record ephemeral task details, procedural steps, or anything already captured in the code, git history, or these files. Convert any relative dates to absolute.
